0,“customer service was awful”,"Not Verified | The WORST customer experience! British Airways (BA) is effectively robbing people! They are not here to help and show no compassion. My partner and I fell ill and had a doctor’s note stating we couldn't fly. BA said they'd hold our flight amount as a voucher valid for a year. Fair enough. Caveat to this (which was not stated to us): you must call them and it is not usable on holiday packages. However, using this voucher was a nightmare. We can't use it for both our tickets because the original was long-haul, and they refuse to refund half the amount. BA's customer service was awful and rude, effectively stealing £400 from us. This policy must stop. We feel held hostage with no solution.",1/10
1,“worst airline I’ve ever flown”,"✅ Trip Verified | The worst airline I’ve ever flown. Could not check in until my flight was open (I was there 2 hours before flight not 2 days before!). Asked if my husband could fly on the same flight (he was also flying club Europe but on a later flight and I could see online that there was room on the plane I was on). The agent said they couldn’t change his flight at the ticket counter (never heard of that). This could only be done online or by calling British Airways. I had already tried online so asked for a telephone number to call and the British Airways agent did not have a number for me to call. So I looked up and called several numbers online and all I got was the office was closed on Saturdays. I asked for the ticket agent again. Explained we were going to his mother’s memorial and that and it would be nice if he could get on the same flight as I was on. They still refused to help. So, he stayed on his flight which was leaving 4 hours later and then got cancelled and he had to spend the night in Florence. They re routed him on a flight to London via Edinburgh. And then they lost his suitcase!! You can’t make this stuff up! As for my flight # BA 525, I got several emails and messages advising me it was delayed. I decided to go to the gate at the original flight time and guess what? It was boarding on time. I can’t imagine the number of people who might of missed it. It’s just an awful, awful airline and I will never fly them again if I can possibly avoid them!",1/10
2,"""only been offered half a glass of water""",✅ Trip Verified | It is almost 11pm we were supposed to take off at 19.20 we are still sitting on the plane at the airport. The worst part is not the technical issue that has kept us grounded but the fact we have only been offered half a glass of water the entire time we have been on board. Being hungry and dehydrated has not helped the situation.,1/10
3,"""onboard like discount carriers""","✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Copenhagen via London on 30th April 2024 Aircrafts were A319 and A320, respectively, both in decent condition. I arrived from Africa, and had to transit and change terminal to T3, which is very cumbersome and tedious. Check-in was quick, easy, and professional, got my desired seats due to silver status at BA. From T3 I had to go through one of the worst security checks ever encountered, fragmenting almost every item in my carry-ons. Their Escape Lounge in T3 is quite decent, particular beer choices and prosecco sparkling wine. Food was very poor, neither any savoury snacks nor meaty food at all. Good tarmac view. First flight was delayed, forcing me to catch the 2nd in LHR within ½ hour. However, I was informed clearly at gate upon arriving in LHR, assisting me on next gate and the airline managed to transfer the luggage in this extremely narrow timeslot. Onboard, only a mini-bottle of water and some bagged crumbs were given, fairly useless and superfluous. No IFE or WiFi. Annoying charity beggings from FAs on both flights are intrusive, annoying, disrespectful, and degrades the airline. Offerings onboard like discount carriers, except being pricier. Arrived final destination on time and so did my luggage.",6/10
4,"""Flight attendants welcoming""","✅ Trip Verified |  Check in fast and friendly. Security a breeze. Lounge was busy early evening but comfortable and clean. Flight attendants welcoming. Seat a nightmare it was the reverse/forward with a step over from the window seat, who the hell thought that was a good idea?? Meal were OK but all curry based, like curry and I was on a flight to India so. FA was brilliant as the only flyer awake on an overnight flight. Improving since my last BA flight",7/10
5,"""stick to their cabin bag size limit""","Not Verified |  The flight was comfortable enough but with an hour delay on the return leg. However, on both leg I was told I had to put my very small and expensive cabin case into the hold as the flight was full. Having done so I was not amused to see other passengers bringing much larger cases into the cabin. BA should stick to their cabin bag size limit and not inconvenience those who comply.",8/10
6,"""it's truly awful for short-haul""","Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price.",1/10
7,"""Is this how low BA has fallen?""","✅ Trip Verified |  London Heathrow to Istanbul at the start of the half-term school holidays and so the flight was very busy indeed. Boarding was quite well managed with neatly presented and pleasant gate agents one of whom went out of her way to assist an elderly passenger with mobility issues. I felt singled out by a member of the BA crew who insisted that my small bag was taken and checked-in. Other passengers had large bags and were not stopped from taking them onto the flight. During the flight I felt that a staff member was very unprofessional towards me. I had an aisle seat and he spoke at length to the couple sitting next to me about their country of origin. I may as well have been invisible. The same member of the cabin crew then disappeared and returned with a selection of drinks and snacks from Business class for his compatriots. He managed to spill some liquid on me and did not even acknowledge me.  The A320 was clean, no IFE and not even a route-map to follow the journey. It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen? I also noted tension between the same member of the cabin crew and 2 of his colleagues. This is not good enough. Disembarkation was remarkably orderly and civilized and the captain made an effort to engage with passengers during the flight with sensible updates.",3/10
8,“appalling service”,"✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked.",2/10
9,"""airline is a total disgrace""","✅ Trip Verified |  As always when I fly BA it was a total shambles. I was booked Manchester - London - Madrid , BA first leg and Iberia 2nd, I try wherever possible to avoid BA, however the Manchester - London was late, however I ran for my IB flight and got to B gates just as boarding started, being Group 1 I went to board and the gate sounded an alarm, BA had removed me from the IB flight to a BA flight 3 hours later! As BA had reissued the ticket IB could not put me back on the flight, so 3 hours wasted because of BA’s total incompetence. This airline is a total disgrace, the crew were not nice, typical BA crew oh im so fabulous I don't need to be nice to paying passengers, club europe cramped and terrible food!",1/10
10,“I couldn’t fault them”,"✅ Trip Verified | This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them. As we were connecting, we had little interaction with ground staff - staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful. Cabin crew on the flight were great - very welcoming and friendly. Our meals were delicious & no shortage of drinks being offered. The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline. We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm. Bags (checked in at JFK) were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving.",10/10
11,"""Service was fantastic""","✅ Trip Verified |   Credit to BA - Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great. Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food, entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences. You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA - Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews. Nice one BA for 2 great flights.",9/10
12,"""Service level far worse then Ryanair""","✅ Trip Verified |  4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time. So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise, 4h before departure? Anyhow - we took the one hour delay so what - but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage. I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage. Overall 2h later at home than planed, with really no reason, just due to incompetent people. Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price. Really never again. Thanks for nothing.",1/10
13,"""A totally unremarkable flight""","Not Verified |  A totally unremarkable flight, on time, as comfortable as European configuration goes. No catering due to the storm - effect greatly exaggerated. This was advised by email, and a euro 15 was provided - not easy to use - but lounge made up for this loss.",8/10
14,"""little concern for customer service""","Not Verified |  I have flow on BA several times since the airline started non-stop service between Austin, TX and London Heathrow. Every year the service gets worse. I brought a tape measure with me to see how far apart the seats are in the economy section. 25½ inches. BA has removed bathrooms in order to squeeze a few more rows of seats onto the aircraft. Thankfully I'm not a big person and was able to squeeze into my seat without being too uncomfortable. When BA first started flying out of Austin, the food was great. Now, when I arrive at Heathrow, I get real food and take it on the plane with me. I don't know where or who makes BA's food, but it is not eatable. If BA did not have a direct flight from my hometown to London, I would fly with a different airline. When we checked into Heathrow, the line was extremely long and only one person was checking people in. It took nearly an hour to get to the counter. I understand airlines are making record profits and need to make up lost revenue from the pandemic, but I think BA has gone too far and has little concern for customer service in pursuit of profits.",1/10
15,"""Boarding flight took an hour""","✅ Trip Verified |   BA has a real problem with boarding it's flights. Those who get on first fill the luggage bins with 2 bags, one of which is supposed to be small and under seat only. Cabin staff don't bother implementing their own rules. Subsequent passengers mill up and down the aisle, bumping into each other, searching for space. Boarding this flight took an hour as a result of this nonsense. The incoming flight was late already so our 90 minute flight was 90 minutes late.",1/10
16,"""The worst journey in my life""","✅ Trip Verified |  The worst journey in my life. The connection time at LHR was only 1 hour, but the flight from MXP was on delay. I had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack. After that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutes. Despite that, upon arrival at SJC my baggage was lost. I filled the form and gave to the employee. I was not given any receipt, so I did not have any reference number. BA phone number at SJC simply never answer. I called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address. I had to enter myself online, dealing with a shitty website. They delivered the baggage three days later. I claimed for compensation online, as I had to buy clothes and other stuff and I did never get a receipt. I was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to MXP, but nothing happened, neither they allowed me to enter BA lounge at SJC. Bad customer service. The only positive side was price, but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if I knew , I would never flown by BA. Never again!",3/10
17,"""Club Europe doesn’t feel very premium""","✅ Trip Verified | Check in and security clearance very quick at LHR T5. My wife and I used the Galleries North lounge and at 6-00am it was easy to get a seat. Good buffet breakfast options. Flight boarded on time and flight departed on time. I was seated in 4 A, the Club Europe seats on the A320 seem to be getting smaller and legroom (I am 6ft) was very tight. Cabin Crew service was fine. I chose the full English breakfast, it was ok, but there was a lot of water in the bottom of the bowl. Flight landed on time. Overall an OK flight but Club Europe doesn’t feel very premium these days.",6/10
18,"""good, but not spectacular""","✅ Trip Verified | Mumbai to London Heathrow in Business Class on an ageing B777-200. This aircraft featured the older Club World flatbed seats. They are comfortable, there is enough storage space around the cubicle, and the monitor screen is among the larger ones I've seen on airplanes. BA's new Club Suites are said to be far superior, competing with the best B-class rivals. The entire Business Class cabin had just 2 washrooms but it wasn't an issue on this flight since the premier section wasn't at full capacity. There was Wi-Fi on board, fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps. Service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth. The food was alright and no more. The biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of Bombay at 1:10 pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from India. The airport experience is far more pleasant at this time. In summary: British Airways provides a good, but not spectacular, Business Class product.",8/10
19,"""still waiting for reimbursement""","Not Verified |  BA cancelled our flight and could not book us onto any flight for the next 4 days. I had to spend £5k in expenses to get us back with another airline. 2 months later I am still waiting for reimbursement and have had no response to my 3 written complaints. Even the call centre staff tell me that head office have taken down the telephone number and email for the department who deal with this, so even they cannot escalate or inquire. Utterly useless.",1/10
20,"""superior to mainline British Airways""",✅ Trip Verified |  Good domestic flight operated by BA Cityflyer. Ground service at check-in Edinburgh airport was particularly friendly and helpful. The flight departed on time and arrived earlier than scheduled. A complimentary drink and snack (albeit tiny!) were served. Generally it seems that the quality of the Cityflyer subsidiary is superior to the mainline British Airways flights.,10/10
21,"""lives in their past glory""",✅ Trip Verified | An airline that lives in their past glory and heading a future of crisis is British Airways. I am not joking we are a family of 7 all in Business Class heading for a Norwegian and Arctic Cruise and they lost 10 of our bags! They will never see me on any of their flights ever a disaster of an airline,1/10
22,"""another great experience""","✅ Trip Verified | Another really great pair of flights, on time, no problems at all, champagne was ok and my meal choices were great, the new club suite is a good improvement over the previous seat, in flight entertainment could have been better, can’t wait to fly with BA again and enjoy another great experience.",9/10
23,"""Boarding was chaotic""","Not Verified |  Airport check in was functionary with little warmth but some efficiency. Flight was delayed with no communication given. Boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff. Seats on board are tight and you really feel like they have crammed in every seat possible. There is next to no recline. However I was thankful that there was no recline. If the person in front had even the slightest recline they would be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this A321 aircraft. No amenities on this flight except for a toilet that was clean but small. No IFE, no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly. Luggage arrived at the carousel within a very short amount of time.",3/10
24,"""WiFi didn't work""","Not Verified | You can buy sandwiches and crisps but don't expect a hot meal. Because the plane is a narrow body , there are no screens. Not helping matters is the fact that the BA prebooking shop for food didn't recognise the flight number, and the onboard  WiFi didn't work.",4/10
25,"""so callous and uncaring""",✅ Trip Verified | Flight at 8.40am from DUB to LCY cancelled 1155pm night before. No text message. No phone. Waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option. Hang on? What’s this! It was dark at 5am. It was hard to see mobile phone screen. I’m still jet lagged. Only option was to LHR at 9.20am. Tried calling. No one there. So accepted it. But I didn’t see the day change! It was the next day! I didn’t want the flight (as was staying at Docklands hence choosing LCY but thought I better take it as it’s leaving an hour after the original flight. Nope. I better call to say hey sorry I screwed up. Your flight is not going to work for me. I don’t have any more accommodation in Dublin and I don’t want to waste one night in London. Called. The most surly customer service (can you even be called that when you treat people like this) answered. She kept calling me James (not my name). She was brutal. You accepted it. I can’t do anything. She basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion I accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer. She kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen. But if you had called us we could have put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! Why didn’t you call? You are at fault. Just so callous and uncaring. She wanted to charge me 600 pounds in new flights and change fees. I said nope and booked a flight today with Ryanair. Plus I need to find my way from Gatwick to Docklands. More money from me because of BA’s utter contempt for their passengers. I’ve been flying Qantas for 25 years and they can do some funky stuff. But never this level of cruelty because of one simple error. Never again. How do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude? Welcome to the U.K.! Just wow.,1/10
26,"""worst experience in all my years of travel""","✅ Trip Verified | The worst experience in all my years of travel. My first flight with my two kids from Boston to London was delayed by 2 hours, resulting in me missing my connecting flight. Despite having a layover of approximately 2.5 hours, I ended up waiting until 4.30 pm to board my flight to Cairo. Unfortunately, even that flight was delayed. I would strongly advise avoiding this particular airline, even if it means paying a bit more for a different option.",1/10

28,"""most appalling airline service""","✅ Trip Verified |  I will never travel with British Airways again. I spent over $10,000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the UK. First, the Boeing 787-9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are getting in reality is premium economy. The seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half. They have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet, which wakes up that passenger. The whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have someone push over the top of you. Second, the food was disgusting. Third, the service terrible. Fourth, the toilet was tiny. Fifth, the inflight screen was fixed and too high so I could not see anything. Sixth, their baggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and I had to pay more (no free airport transfers with British Airways). Seventh, the charging points did not work. The second leg to London was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle. That was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not one piece. This means that you are sleeping on a metal bar (the seat) where there is a gap in the seat. To add insult to injury I now find that both flights back to Sydney are on the small plane. To book a seat before check in is $170. I paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left. This is why I got the worst seat in the house going out. This is the most appalling airline service I have ever encountered. There is no point paying for business class in British Airways.",1/10
29,"""It was a nightmare""","Not Verified |  They changed our Flights from Brussels to London Heathrow to LAX on 4/16/2023. We paid extra to choose our seats. Since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought, they seated us in totally different seats. I asked the check in employee, she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight. From London to LAX was worse, nobody in the airport help us. Employees from BA told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal 3 and sleep there. Finally one employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel. It was a nightmare this airline. We missed one day work and BA didn’t return the money that we paid for our previous chosen seats.",2/10
30,"""I enjoyed my flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  I enjoyed my flight. The boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional. The food selection was good and I enjoyed the quality. The was only one downside - when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at T5, so in total from landing to getting the doors open it took 30 minutes. I believe the Heathrow T5 were having strike action that week.",9/10
31,"""Very poor service, very frustrating""","✅ Trip Verified |  Very poor service, very frustrating. Firstly my flight to LHR was cancelled on 16 Mar23, while I got a text message to inform me, the information desk was unable to confirm if was correct or scam. Once this was confirmed, I went to the counter to get my new boarding pass. At the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotel. We (me and other fellow travelers) waited for over 45mins, there was no one at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions. The transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airport. When we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30. that was a rush. It appeared more of a Motel than an hotel. The room - was smelling of weed, being a non-smoker this was uncomfortable. Although I wanted to compromise and rest, when I went to wash my face, the tap on the sink came off in my hands, I panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room. After some discussion, they agreed to change it. I went to the alternate room, to my horror, it was occupied. I asked the staff to call a cab, and I left.",1/10
32,"""I was left stranded at the airport""","Not Verified |  Booked a flight return flight between London and Munich for 3/11 to 3/17 in December. The return flight was cancelled and re-booked from 3/17 to 3/12. British Airways only notified me of the first change, but not the second. Getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasions. Each time needing to find a helpful representative. British Airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket. They tried to charge an $800 change fee. Through repeatedly calling back, British Airways reinstated my 3/17 flight on 2/20 and then again on 3/6. To make sure it did not get changed again, i checked the status of my ticket daily from 3/12 to 3/15. It was intact those days. On 3/16 when it was time to check-in for the flight, it was gone. At the airport the staff at the British Airways check-in counter are not BA employees, so cannot help resolve problems. There are no BA representative at the Munich Airport. The confirmation documentation from British Airways was of no value. I was left stranded at the airport.",1/10
33,"""Total disruption, wasted time""","✅ Trip Verified |  The incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because French Air Traffic Controllers were on strike so we were routed over Germany, and not BA's fault. O arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance. It took around 40 minutes to find someone. Then when that was done there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge. All told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gate. Total disruption, wasted time. Absolutely no excuse for this.",1/10

36,"""flight was one of the worst""","✅ Trip Verified |  This flight was one of the worst I have ever had in my life. I wanted to pamper myself, so I bought business class. I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price.",2/10
37,"""the worst business class experience I've ever had""","✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to ""upload my COVID documents"" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any ""COVID documentation"" - I was informed (several hours later) that my ""COVID documents have been verified"". I then received another text message urging me to ""upload my COVID documentation"". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the ""chicken or fish?"" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a ""ploughman's lunch"" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2"" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2"" height. The ""Priority"" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery.",1/10
38,"""treat your customers like idiots""","✅ Trip Verified |  Another BA Shambles. Started off well with excellent check in at first at t5, mid afternoon so avoided the early morning, evening scrum. Into the Concorde lounge, excellent service again. Great choice of cocktails, wine etc. Food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable. Called to the boarding gate. Chaos, people jostling for position to get on the plane. People with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first bankrolling the flight and most of them well over 5. We get on to be told that none of the lights in first can be dimmed at all, so the lights were on all night. It was like being detained and interrogated! Excellent wine and champagne selection. Dinner menu handed out. I’ll have the prawn cocktail to start please. No you won’t as they’ve only loaded one for 8 people and the guy in 1A got it. I bet he felt like he’d won the lottery. Ok I’ll have the beef wellington, basically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce. Mains,  I’ll have the curry, no you won’t as they’ve substituted that with Christmas dinner.  I’m going to the Maldives to get away from Christmas. I ended up with short ribs that were inedible, no salad starter, no water offered, no bread roll. I just couldn’t eat it. So basically my husband and I have spent £20,000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving. No apologies. Watch out BA as Virgin start flying direct in October. As always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots.",3/10
39,"""learned my lesson about late BA upgrades""","✅ Trip Verified |  When I tried to check in online, I was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under £300. I decided to take it, but then the website wouldn't allow me to choose seats or to check in. I phoned BA and was happy that the call was picked up quickly, but I was then told that because I had changed my booking, I had to check in at the airport. So we turned up three hours before the flight, only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium. The check-in agent was helpful but couldn't fix and suggested we try the BA desk airside. That desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line, we were told to try at the boarding gate. At the gate, we finally managed to get one aisle seat and one window, not sitting together. After going through that, the flight was surprisingly good, with decent food and very good service. We flew back economy, which wasn't too bad either. The flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic, and Emma and Daniel, who looked after us, could not have been better. I've obviously learned my lesson about late BA upgrades, but everything else was good.",6/10
40,"""Will honestly never fly them again if I can help it""",✅ Trip Verified | Flew from Amman to London on Nov. 14 2022. Not sure what type of aircraft it was. My Ticket was economy plus. The flight is 5h35m. We received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips. The seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system. Any other food or drink had to be purchased. So we couldn't even get a warm cup of coffee or teas. It is the third time I have flown with BA recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review. Will honestly never fly them again if I can help it.,4/10
41,"""has returned to full service""","✅ Trip Verified |  A great flight. The suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort. British has returned to full service so meals were coursed, menus and hot towels provided…etc Food was quite good with choices provided for both meals. Service was ok, I prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but that’s my preference. Entertainment was good as was connectivity. No real complaints except a minor one. The tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position. I actually felt like I was in a true business class, not by Qatar’s standards, but that’s another story.",9/10
42,"""Would recommend""",✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with hand baggage but security at Dubai was quick. Entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound.

44,"""not been recompensed for our expenses""","✅ Trip Verified |  Our flight in March 2022 from San Francisco to London on 28th March was cancelled with 3 hours’ notice. We found out on the shuttle bus to the airport. We had to stay overnight for the next day flight. We still have not been recompensed for our expenses (filled in on line) and have received no replies on follow-ups. It is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up. During this trip, we had to re-schedule a return flight (my wife was ill). This should not have been a problem as the flights were re-bookable. We were given a voucher. This voucher was only bookable by phone. When I phoned to rebook, we got the automated voice saying BA were not taking flight bookings by phone. You can see the problem - how do a use a voucher where I must phone and they are not taking phone bookings ? All I have been offered is another voucher. The time to use has passed. It must be great to be a business that can print endless A4 vouchers and not return money paid for services not rendered. We returned home with Aer Lingus with no drama.",1/10
45,"""2 suitcases lost in 2 flights""","✅ Trip Verified |  Holidays ruined, 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights I travelled from London Heathrow to Amsterdam with my brother, before boarding we were told we couldn't take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin, so they sent them to the cargo. At our arrival in Amsterdam, one of the suitcases was missing, left at London Heathrow, so we had to fill in a report in Amsterdam, this was 3 days ago and we still don't have the suitcase or any information about it. Today I travelled from Amsterdam to London City Airport, again they didn't allow me to board with my cabin suitcase, and when I arrived in London, the suitcase was missing, left in Amsterdam. 2 Suitcases, 2 different flights, they've ruined my holidays. No compensation, no dates on when will I get my property back, no information, lies and more lies.  I was told I could complain online and buy all the things I need, shoes, toiletries, clothes, and I might receive the money back in 30 days! Yes, I might.",1/10
46,"""Crew were attentive and charming""",✅ Trip Verified | Routine typical BA domestic shuttle flight. Nothing special.

Someone behind us had to tell us. we had a connecting flight and spent a lot of money on our holiday. the refund takes ages. Overall not happy at all.",1/10
48,"""food choice and quality was poor""","✅ Trip Verified |  This a new route which BA introduced at the beginning of June after several years of Covid related delays. The business class experience was I fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade. Plus - helpful and friendly FA. Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor. I don't know what the business class offerings from BA's rivals flying similar routes are like, but the experience does not match up to that provided by Singapore Airlines on their flights to the Far East and Australasia.",4/10
49,"""the nicest crew I've ever had""",✅ Trip Verified |  The crew BA656 on 6 June absolutely made this flight. Smooth journey with possibly the nicest crew I've ever had. Rebooking for September we were that impressed.,10/10
50,"""economy style with an unsold middle seat""",Not Verified |  Business class seating shown as a 2x2 configuration on the website is economy style with an unsold middle seat - not much more comfortable than economy. Meal service started with three options but was down to 2 options by row 5 (out of 8 in business class) and by row 6 where we were seated only one of us had 2 options then only grilled tofu was available for the rest of business class.,2/10
51,"""I’m extremely frustrated""","Not Verified |  On my flight from LAX to LHR I paid to pick my seat for my flight back to LAX. I saw the $116 come out of my account the next day. As I’m adding in my booking the day before my flight, the website tells me I no longer have a booked seat and the seat I paid for has been sold to someone else. I spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to DM the airline on Twitter which I find extremely inappropriate but I still reached out anyway because I was unable to find another way to contact them. On Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding. They just left my message unread. After about 6 hours of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being able to find a chat line on their website. While talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. After a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. Soon after I tried to pull up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find it. I would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed the page but it did not. I continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the booking. I’m not able to find the chat line again and I will not DM a company on Twitter with my support issues again. I’m extremely frustrated.",3/10
52,"""was a really bad experience""",Not Verified |  We had a trip with 4 flights included. All 4 flights were delayed. The worst with 2h15min. Also one flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a 4h earlier flight loosing 4h of our short vacation. No explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays. I expected a lot better as I have earlier used BA with good results. This was a really bad experience and I will avoid using BA for any further travels.,1/10
53,"""most terrible airline I’ve dealt with""","✅ Trip Verified | British Airways is the most terrible airline I’ve dealt with. They have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment - we have tried for a week now to speak to someone as we can’t make the changes online. They hang up on you every time you call them - we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers. You can’t check in online, the application sucks so much you’re better off trying to code your own app and it’ll probably work better, every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we can’t verify your documents yet the app and website say you’re verified and ready to go. You upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says it’s guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online won’t work, they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return.  I hope I never have the misfortune of getting stuck flying with British Airways ever again.",1/10
54,"""stop nickel and diming""","✅ Trip Verified |  Flew to Barbados 16 March on BA 255 in the new Club Class suite. A huge improvement on the old yin and yang Club Class which we unfortunately endured on the way back. Comfortable, big TV screen with high quality picture and good headphones, plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private. Nice friendly FA's (called by my name from the off) and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served. Once again let down by a poor (at best) choice of movies on the in-flight entertainment system. Thank goodness the latest James Bond movie was showing. Took off and landed on time. Smooth flight. Only one letdown - the usual extortionate fee charged for pre-booking a seat. Come on BA, stop nickel and diming - it spoils what could be a really good Business Class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege. I recommend with the usual caveats.",9/10
55,"""really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class""","✅ Trip Verified | I really can’t believe they have the audacity to call this First Class. The check in staff at Singapore were abrupt and unhelpful. The official BA lounge in Singapore was closed, so they’re using a cheap generic alternative, which anyone can pay twenty pounds to go in. Suffice to say it was not pleasant. Onboard was like being in the middle of a bad comedy sketch. I can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training. I had to ask for slippers. The first drink took nearly an hour to arrive, despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them. The poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine, which came filled to the brim. I mean it’s First Class, not a student house party. Neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu. Most of the food was awful. My steak was dry, over cooked and tough, and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately. I will say, the cheese and port were nice. However the worst thing was the constant galley noise. There was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat (1K) which they were in and out of all night, and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming. They also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat, so we’re in and out of that as well. I will say the seat itself is very well designed, but personally I’m happy in Club and would never do First again.",3/10
56,"""smacks of continued cost-cutting""","✅ Trip Verified | The economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight, with only about 30 passengers, but business class was three-quarters full. Boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take-off on schedule. Sadly, BA59 makes use of the old Club World product, which now seems like a step back in time after experiencing the new Club Suite on BA42/43. There are some good points about the old Club World - the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat - but other than those, it's an embarrassment. The tiny, poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief. Service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current, overly cautious, post-Covid requirements, with everything served at the same time. This does mean that the meal is over and done with relatively speedily, but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to BA's competitors and smacks of continued cost-cutting. Queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean. Arrival was on schedule, but Covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our baggage.",5/10
57,"""Appalling customer service""",✅ Trip Verified |  Appalling customer service - they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking. Hours and hours on the telephone with no response (or you just get a recorded message to say they can't take the call). They don't respond to emails sent to the complaints line.,1/10
58,"""complete disregard for your passengers""","✅ Trip Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!",1/10
59,"""the legroom was appalling""","Not Verified |  First of this was one of the smoothest UK to US flights I have taken. The boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all. They called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which I appreciate why but why call families? The worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling. The entertainment system is basic, it does not support Bluetooth headphones, the USB does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphones input was as good as useless.  The crew were nice so sorry I missed that.",3/10
60,"""whole experience was stressful, costly""","✅ Trip Verified |  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.",1/10

I am not a fan of the new NEO aircraft. Very cramped seating and uncomfortable. The armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for one. Aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the back seems awkward. I have done a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and it’s not for me.

I offered to pay a fee to get the second seat changed to my sister's name but British Airways refused us to board and sent us home. However, the staff member who I spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which I would get shortly so that I could fly at another time with BA since they do not offer refunds. I never received these flight vouchers. I have chased numerous times on the phone with BA staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers would be sent to me. They have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers, they say I was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate. I have sent numerous emails to BA explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers. I have had no response to my emails/messages. One BA staff member on the phone said that I should track down the lady I spoke to at Heathrow and ask her if she remembers me.

On arrival at the aircraft a gentleman who came on a wheelchair had no help with his luggage (I helped). Shame - since lounge service was very good.

It was good to see that check-in carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms. Thanks to just 30 passengers on board, with more than half in Club Europe, the flight took off ahead of time. Service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class, with too much pre-packaging - the COVID effect, presumably. Arrival into T5 was also comfortably ahead of schedule, and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control, we were through the e-gates and collecting our luggage just 20 minutes after landing.",8/10

They promised to give me compensation of hotel stay, food and travel if complete online form.

After take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service (for the whole section - not whole cabin) was not working. And we were sitting into an 11.5hr overnight flight with two little ones, meaning sleeping was not going to happen. We contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation. Sorry they said. During the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed, and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around. To cap it off, we landed at 10pm ET and they had left behind our baby car seat and stroller. We finally received them back 2 days later. Conclusion, never fly BA again.",3/10

Crew very friendly and a long story short after 3 hours on the ground waiting for the di-icing machine we finally made our way to take off. All the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each one and personally looked at their options the BA online app to help them. Non-alcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time. The first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not BA fault that the de-icing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures done we were ready for take-off. How the pilot and team managed this in these conditions I will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way back to Heathrow. Cabin crew provided excellent service. Being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent. Veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely. So just want to thank you BA. We know you get a lot of negative reviews but this is to say we can't fault you. Particularly the crew who made a real effort to talk to all of us. Well done.",10/10
78,"""onboard charity collection is inappropriate""","✅ Trip Verified |  Budapest to Billund return via London on 18 and 28 Dec. 2019. A320 aircrafts. Check-In in Budapest had a narrow timeslot of 2 hours before departure with long queues. I was not recognised as Oneworld elite flyer (hold a Gold Card with Qatar Airways) at check-in and had to struggle to get 2 bags accepted as inscribed luggage. I was denied lounge access as QR does not honour 3rd party lounges any more unless flying on QR. There is no Oneworld  lounge in Budapest, so BA uses Menzies Lounge who would not accept me unless I was with an entitled Oneworld card different from Qatar Airways. For BA I do not have status. In London granted access to any Oneworld lounge. Onboard, food and drinks with hefty price tags,  water is not free. Flights were full, but on time. I found that the onboard charity collection by FAs is inappropriate and intrusive. Luggage delivered perfectly. Return trips (2 legs) were both full flights but departed slightly early. Granted lounge access in Billund in the decent King Amlet and BA Galleries First in T3 in London. Loads of good, hot foods and good beers and wines. Onboard there is no IFE, no seat recline. Mediocre, not cheap. But the FFP is among the best in Oneworld and the gold status of BA is very rewarding.",6/10
79,"""Awful airline""",Not Verified |  Frankfurt to London with British Airways. Awful airline. Put me and my wife at opposite ends of the plane even though we booked together. Gave me middle seat even though many others were free. A childish airline which charges a premium and then goes out to make the journey difficult for you if you don't book biz class. Avoid.,1/10
80,"""excellent with service""",✅ Trip Verified |  Stockholm to London Heathrow. As always BA works excellent with service. On the ground and in the air. They still have a good gin aboard for a decent G&T and even if the meals in Business looks like the came from the 90's economy they taste great.,8/10
81,"""Will never fly BA again""","✅ Trip Verified |  Lisbon to London. I pay extra to check my bag, to ensure I am not using more than my share of overhead space. To have British Airways charge me 50 Euros to check a bag to my final destination, and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat, in a cramped aircraft, to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their bags, is an insult. Will never fly BA again.",1/10
82,"""left a great deal to be desired""",✅ Trip Verified | London Heathrow to Lisbon. Mediocre. The flight was very smooth and arrived on time. Cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions. No bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a ‘nudge’ before it was delivered. Not a great Club Europe experience.,2/10
83,"""downgraded to premium economy""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Cape Town. We had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to Africa. I usually fly Star Alliance, but picked BA for a segment for better connection timing through London to Cape Town. This was a huge mistake. I had tried to reserve seats on BA website twice and was not able to do so. Then I tried to call BA twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call back option. When we arrived today in London from Toronto at the connections desk, seven hours before our flight, we were told that business class was oversold and we would be downgraded to premium economy. BA’s representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats, we were at the bottom of the list for business class, and that loyalty customers would all have priority for seats over us, but we would still be welcome in the lounge, (as if this was a bonus). Then there was a problem for us to clear security to get to the lounge, since they could not print our boarding passes (due to the down grade). It took close to an hour to get settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk. We asked to speak to a manager, but at each of our four interactions with BA staff we were told that they would get some to speak with us, giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could. At one point I got visibly frustrated after the BA staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary, which it definitely was not! After two and a half hours BA customer service managers came to speak with us. They were the first ones who were actually apologetic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective. If British Airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and basic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight, I will not be booking flights on BA again.",1/10
84,"""three hours to get rebooking""","✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to London. Flight attendants very kind when flying in. Return flight was canceled at London City Airport and it took almost three hours to get rebooking, hotel voucher and transportation arranged. That could be done far more efficiently. No water, nothing, no necessities.",1/10
85,"""glorified budget airline""",✅ Trip Verified | London to Athens. British Airways is a glorified budget airline. A 3.5-hour flight and back to Athens and no food or drinks provided. Ask for a cup of water and they charge you a ridiculous price. An M&S inflated price sandwich is the 'meal'. No entertainment options either. No USB charging on the seat as well. Any reputable airline for a flight of this length provides this options in 2019. Yet they charged full-service airline prices. So there is a mismatch. Flew Aegean on the same route and a full meal and drinks are provided.,5/10
86,"""appreciate your excellent service""","✅ Trip Verified |  Yesterday my husband and I decided to to come home from Rome earlier than the scheduled time at 8pm. When I rang BA in London, the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra. Onboard the flight, the steward gave me hot water and milk so that I can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me. While waiting to get off the plane, I had a wonderful conversation with the BA staff who are so pleasant. I love flying with BA and we will continue to do so. We have booked our flight with BA next year. Thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service.",10/10
87,"""Very enjoyable flight""","✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to London. Great flight on the superb A380; in my opinion, the most comfortable and quiet aircraft flying at the moment. Outstanding in flight service from the crew. Attentive, polite and professional; the very best of British Airways service. Food well above average for this cabin - though breakfast could have been better. IFE excellent. The seat is comfortable with a good recline and supplied with a decent, plump cushion and an excellent quilted blanket. Very enjoyable flight. Highly recommended.",9/10
88,"""no different to a budget airline""",✅ Trip Verified | Flying London City to Geneva. The only plus was the Embraer E190 jet had a comfortable interior with plenty of leg room for an economy seat. Other than that BA now offers a basic no frills service that is no different to a budget airline. Yet it charges 'full service' prices!,3/10
89,"""Still recommended by me""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Gothenburg. BA are getting a lot of bad press - deservedly so at present with strikes, IT glitches, baggage problems. However extreme cases will always be highlighted. Two recent flights on BA, and very happy with them. Flight to Gothenburg on A319-100, pushed back 25m late due to a potential technical issue, soon resolved and arrived at GOT only 15m behind schedule. Good crew and the Safety Announcement video was a hoot. Return to LHR on A320-232. On time departure and early arrival at T5. Again good crew. Will be flying with BA again in December (strikes permitting). Still recommended by me as the National Carrier.",9/10
90,"""trip has been really smooth""","Not Verified |  I had a stress free journey with my 8 yr old autistic son and 6 yr old girl from Chennai to London by British airways. The Chennai Ground Service Manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley, screening the luggage, checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person. I am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth. Thank you so much. Inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if I need any help, and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard. I did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at Heathrow airport. Over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with BA and Heathrow airport. #happyautism# Thank you",10/10
91,"""crew were very helpful""","Not Verified |  Inflight crew were very helpful, polite and caring. Though you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to some airlines, it was quite pleasant. The food and drink selection was pretty basic. However the ground staff especially at the check in counter in DXB and lost & found at London heathrow were rude and very unhelpful. I forgot to collect my suit which I had handed to crew member at the time of boarding. Upon approaching the BA counter, the personnel were not willing to help or register a lost and found complain.  Neither any empathy nor any willingness to help.",5/10
92,"""A shambolic airline""",✅ Trip Verified |  Malaga to London Heathrow . A shambolic airline. Rude and incompetent Iberia ground staff in Malaga. BA sent warning of the 2 hour delay just before the late boarding began - sophisticated IT setup they have! Club Europe meal remains a big cutback from 2017 despite what BA claim. Cabin staff were bored from the start and despite 4 serving in Club cabin the service was very poor. Arrived Heathrow at 23.45 and then sat waiting 10 mins for ground staff to show up.  Simply appalling trip and truly ripped off.,2/10

In our flight back to London staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in back of the aircraft. There was not welcome snacks. We sat in the very last row and food choice ended. Only chicken was our option to have. Very sad and staff did not care about this situation.",3/10

95,"""don’t waste your money on an overnight flight""","✅ Trip Verified | Premium economy don’t waste your money on an overnight flight! Going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace! The food (I use this term lightly) wasn’t fit for dogs on our flight, it was salmon we think as it didn’t taste of anything, a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let alone eat it. The veg tasted burnt, bread roll was ok. (Not really a saving grace). One cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and don’t bother asking what was in the box left on our table! I didn’t bother trying it. The look on other people’s faces was good enough for me to know don’t bother! Which in comparison to the outbound flight (London to Orlando) was worlds apart, greeted with a drink which was the first of many, dinner was nice, the steak edible, veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks! Inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be WiFi but couldn’t log on so saved some money there. I really thought this was going to be the best way to travel. Oh a broken seat for one of our party was a bit disappointing, homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane. But that really shouldn’t happen. What is not told when booking, homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have TSA PRE you don’t have to join the massive queue, look for pre entered TSA line that’s the one that’s empty cause they tell no one about it.",7/10

No entertainment of any sort, and food I found exceptionally bad. The B747 that was terribly maintained. The offer of 20.GBP for compensation is insulting and further exemplifies a lack of concern for your passengers comfort and safety.",4/10

I am a frequent flyer with BA and have not always had an amazing experience, this one was. Check in was easy and swift and the Concorde Room was excellent. The flight itself was wonderful, while I accept it isn’t the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to none.

Thanks to the crew.",9/10
103,"""a very good overall service""",✅ Trip Verified |  Dublin to London Heathrow. British Airways offered a very good overall service on this flight. I booked online and found that process very easy. The caveat was not being able to select the seat I wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee. The check-in lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself. The flight departed on-time and the captain made frequent announcements. Within the previous two weeks I had flown with BA twice within Europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff. The flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort. One curiosity was the staff handing out UK landing cards The flight was punctual and reliable.,7/10

Dinner took three hours to be served (on a night flight). My Husband had to go to the Galley twice for his dinner requests, he’d been forgotten. I requested ‘Express’ service, which didn’t happen. Website advertises ‘Premium Levels of Service’ and ‘Every Journey Unique and Unforgettable.’ The service was dreadful, but the journey was definitely unforgettable for the wrong reasons. Don’t waste your money with this airline, you don’t get what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points, and telling you that you don’t pay for the Service, that the extra costs are for taxes, the Lounge and extra loyalty points. All BA could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points. Really?",3/10
105,"""Service on board was excellent""","✅ Trip Verified | The First Class zone at Heathrow T5 and the Concorde Lounge are very good. Service on board was excellent in both directions. The cabin layout is unimpressive and the food is nothing to write home about. The screen is small, with poor resolution. I enjoyed the flights in both directions, mainly because of the service. This First does not compare well with that of Middle Eastern and Asian airlines, but BA business class is so poor, I either fly economy or (when I am very lucky) try to fly First.",8/10

Didn’t wake me for breakfast, not sure why they had me fill in a form for when I wanted to be woken up. No instructions for the transition between BA flights. Now I’m on the flight from Heathrow to Venice, no offer of coffee, water but worse, business class is just coach class, no extra leg room, just 3 seats with the middle one blocked out.

From the moment that I boarded this flight (due to take off at 19.25), the crew had one interest and one only - to get the cabin lights off, which they duly achieved two hours later. As a consequence, the service was negligent in the extreme. This was a Club World ticket - so expensive and I looked forward to a decent level of service. However, I wasn't offered champagne on boarding, wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal. I complained to BA when I got home but they weren't interested and I was met with a barrage of corporate platitudes.

We had very grand seats with lovely surroundings. The cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to get to know us and understand what we wanted. The food and alcoholic drinks were great. I went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding. I was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the IFE. My wife and I both said afterwards that it didn't feel like a long-haul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably. My only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep.,9/10

I have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check-in and on-flight catering, for economy. However BA have stripped both the above perks. I now struggle to see the value, and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of Easyjet, yet you pay almost double. Then today I flew back from Denmark with SAS, and it was amazing and made BA look cheap. Not only do you get a good meal on board, you get free drink, can charge your electronics and get wifi (for only 2.9 Euros!). Outstanding.",4/10

The seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft fresh. During the second flight from LHR to AMS, the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliers and made jokes only frequent fliers would understand.

My costs would  be reimbursed. The airport staff also said no further help from British Airways is available on the day to due airport issues. I felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty +300 GBP fare for a short haul flight for the next day. As it was Christmas, prices were very high. After I arrived at my destination, a lengthy exchange of messages with British Airways started, and British Airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline (opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation).",1/10

I would have missed my presentation by the time we would arrive. My trip was supposed to be 4 days so by the time of arrival I had to return in less than two days. They advised us to cancel the flight and promised to refund our flight tickets as well as the expenses for our accommodation since it was to late to cancel our booking. I filed a claim online based on their instruction.  The customer relation phone number is disconnected. In fact the automatic voice mail says “please don’t chase a call”!

There is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry-on baggage except in the bin above. The food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to get.

Boarding at FCO was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2. Flight attendants friendly and welcoming. Seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight. There was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased - even water. No entertainment either. Was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the M&S menu. Connection at T5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon. Boarding for the flight to Newark was organised and painless. I was dreading this 787 flight a little based on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped. Happy to say, the seat comfort was pretty good, legroom was manageable. I was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft (i checked), it was pretty dirty. There was grime around the USB port (which didn't work), tv screen and along the floor by the wall. The cushion on the seatback in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well. I found the touchscreen IFE to be outdated and slightly slow in response. The selection was not as extensive but I did find some excellent British content that I had not seen before. The real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience shone through in just how consistently friendly, professional and warm they were with their service. They were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick. The main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing. All in all, a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector.",7/10

Obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm, dry and I was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the food. Not the same as my husbands meal, so I have to take the airlines word LSML that it was low sodium. Attendants serving coffee missed us and when I pressed the call button it was over 15 minutes before a flight attendant showed up. One pass through the cabin for drinks. After that, you had to go to the back of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink. Sandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendous. Hummus, limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the least. I expected edible food and better, more friendly service with this airline. Our flight attendant was stone faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal. Before landing many people still had trash but no final walk through by our invisible flight crew. I thought British Airways was better than this.",3/10

We are strict vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flight. Meals were delivered as usual, and had the vegan slip on them, but as I was about to start eating I noticed that I had been given butter - this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal. When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it. I had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). It turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in it. Needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. Shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh I don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk"". I had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. When she returned she said 'We don't provide that sort of thing."" That was strange, because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. So we had no meals, no hot drinks, and our video screen did not work. The Customer Service that followed from was more appalling, they could not care less, it took ages to get replies and when i did I was just palmed off. After several months of having to write emails I was informed that I had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper, which was just another way of getting rid of us. So we did this, after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation - basically the value of the meals that we could not eat - in vouchers.",1/10
125,"""gone notably downhill""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Amsterdam. BA's service has gone notably downhill in the past couple of years, but tonight's experience really takes the biscuit. I should now be in Amsterdam - however, I am still writing this from London despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere. We boarded just about on time, around 1930, only to be told that due to weather there would be a delay of an hour or so. Shortly after, we were told that the routes north of LHR were shut, and no planes were taking off. About an hour into the ordeal, we were told that the airspace had reopened, but there would be a 90 minute wait for a slot. One more hour in, we were told airspace was shut again. After 3 hours, good news! - or so we thought - we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later. We did then leave the gate, and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway. We were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that AMS would be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we would have arrived, so our flight wad cancelled. We taxied back to the gate, where we waited a further 10-15 minutes for ground staff to become available. I must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal, the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat, and the cabin crew were very good. The crew gave us the in-flight service (minus alcohol) so we were well fed and watered. This is the full extent of my praise though. Little was I to know that the real disaster was still to come. BA's ground handling was attrocious. We were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings. However, BA had cancelled around 7 flights, and the queues were very lengthy. Vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel ballroom because ""all the rooms were full"". I have never heard anything like it. This is beyond unbelievable. No assistance for children, elderly, and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers, as is the norm in this situation. Further, the promised ""rebooking"" staff had all gone home - I was told to consult the BA app the following morning. BA's app has rebooked my flights - two days later, when my trip was for three days total. The feature on the app to select a different date for my flights, so I can replan my trip for another weekend, is broken. I guess I'll be trying out their call centre in the morning. This is all simply appalling. We all understand that adverse weather happens. But to keep us on a plane for 4+ hours when they knew before boarding that there would be delays is not on. Moreover, BA surely know the opening hours of their destination airports. Why they could not have prioritised the AMS flight over flights to 24-hour airports I do not know. And as for the ground handling, I have never had an experience this bad. BA staff themselves were thin on the ground - they left most of the work to Heathrow staff, who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the ""we don't work for BA excuse"". I've had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review, because they genuinely couldn't have handled it better. By contrast, I don't see how BA could have handled this worse. They really are indistinguishable from the budget airlines these days, save for the good lounges if you fly business.",1/10
126,"""lounges in Heathrow are overcrowded""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Frankfurt. I need to fly BA for Business frequently, as I don't have other choices. Not only planes are delayed (as today), but the lounges in Heathrow are a joke. I don't use them anymore as they are overcrowded, and they don't serve proper food, just snacks. Their customer service is horrible and never helps me with any requests. Their business class in Europe is economy class with a free seat next to you.",1/10
127,"""not sitting together""",✅ Trip Verified |  London to Madrid. Lazy seat allocation has led to my husband and I not sitting together.  I understand I can pay to get a seat I want but other than having a seat next to my husband I don’t want any particular seat. We are travelling as a pair. There are three seats each side of the aisle. There will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they don’t know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit. BA bothering to do the seat allocations for all the passengers you don’t wish to pay for specific seats would avoid this.,2/10
128,"""Disappointing experience""","✅ Trip Verified |  Mumbai to London Heathrow. Disappointing experience. I wouldn't book business class again, felt like bad value for money. I've flown economy and premium economy before, found economy basic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space. I expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food, better seat and a larger entertainment screen I really didn't see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost. The staff weren't that attentive so I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight. I had one person ask if I needed anything who then brought me the tea I requested. The staff were helpful when I saw them but overall what a waste of money. I paid an extra £500+ for better food on a tray with cutlery. Really not worth it!",6/10
129,"""unexpected problem with the systems""","✅ Trip Verified |  Calgary to London. Cabin full. Overhead locker full of blankets. Seat excruciatingly uncomfortable and headphone that worked intermittently. Take off about 1945 local time. Evening meal appeared at about 2030 local time. Menu listed seasonal salad (leaf, one small piece of lettuce and cucumber), braised short rib of beef or mushroom ravioli pasta, with butter pecan cake. Only 3 beef meals available. Choice was either pasta or to go hungry. I chose the latter and dined on a small bottle of water and half a cup of tomato juice. Breakfast (a light refreshment including juice, tea and coffee) consisted of a cream cheese roll, and oat biscuit, and half a cup of warm tea some 30 minutes later. We paid extra for World Traveller Plus but I consider that we were conned. Customer services have been useless and on the second time of writing I received the following response, ""Thanks for coming back to us. I completely understand why you’re disappointed we couldn’t offer you our full catering service, especially as on such a long haul flight. I hope our staff explained our catering supplier had an unexpected problem with the systems they use to deliver their catering. This meant they couldn’t provide a full meal service and I absolutely agree this isn’t what you would expect when you travel with us. I’m sorry we’ve let you down."" That is it. Thank you BA. This is the last time we will ever book long haul with you.",2/10
130,"""very good service indeed""","Not Verified |  First time flying with British Airways in economy on a Transatlantic flight from London to Chicago. I was impressed by the hard work of the professional and friendly Flight Attendants. They walked up and down the plane helping people with various issues and offering good tasty meals, snacks and drinks of all kinds. I will definitely fly British overseas again given a chance. The economy seats on this old but well kept Boeing 747-400 were very comfortable and I am a 5'9"" x 240lbs and still did not feel cramped. I would encourage all my friends to fly British if they want to have a very comfortable flight from the US to Europe. Thank You British Airways, very good service indeed.",10/10
131,"""unhelpful and unprofessional""","✅ Trip Verified | Turin to London Gatwick. Rubbish check-in service, as bad as Ryanair. I show the staff my mobile boarding pass, checked website that I have 2 x 32 kg bags checked allowance. One bag was over 23 kg (27/28), they refused to honour the 32 kg allowance and told me I will risk myself to miss the flight and not able to check in. They were so rude and unhelpful. Boarding was with the same unhelpful and unprofessional staff with the very arrogant manner. Flight was delayed without the checked-in agent saying anything, after all passengers board they start to tell people there will be an hour or so delay due to weather. At the very least the young crew serve passenger complimentary juice or water during the wait.",2/10
132,"""IFE is a work of mystery""","✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to London. This was the second part of my Sydney to London trip and looked forward to it as it was on a BA A380. Now this aircraft, in Qantas colours, is one I am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with QF. As mentioned in my review of BA16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problem. The same comments for that review apply here. The IFE is a work of mystery in terms of content. On Qantas, American, Cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choices. Those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (Godfather, Gladiator, Brave-heart, Roman Holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to see. Some smart edgy team in Soho, London pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. IFE is one thing on long haul. The other is food and beverage. The food quality was just substandard and something I read about constantly. On Qantas (say QF1 from Singapore to London) one gets the evening meal service, followed by Weiss ice cream, a Lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. At the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuits. You would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. BA need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. The A380 is a flagship aircraft and on Qantas it is treated as such. I am a Qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. Put the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. The BA crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. One guy looked like Steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserable. Flying on an A380 should be an experience and I enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. BA have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. That is sad given the stature of BA. I came back on BA31 from London to Hong Kong and the same comments apply. Hard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely.",4/10
133,"""I had to buy a new return ticket""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Montreal. I did my online check-in the night before and left to go to the airport. I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours in advance, went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass, and the kiosk wasn't working, so I proceeded to the BA counter to get my pass and check in my luggage. I was in line for approximately 15 minutes when we were all told to switch lines. The line we were moved to was substantially longer however I was patient. By the time I got to the desk, an hour had passed, and I had a bit over an hour left to my flight. I figured this was tight but all the while manageable since I trusted BA's system. The woman at the counter asked me where I was going and when I said Montreal, she looked at me and said ""you won't make it"". I explained the situation how I had been in the airport for several hours already and that I was in line for 1 hour. She just told me I needed to go to the missed flight counter. I got to the counter and they informed me that I had to buy a new return ticket. My original return ticket cost me $800, my return cost me $1350.  I had no choice but to buy the ticket. I also had to stay in a hotel and then take a bus to Gatwick airport the following morning. Once I arrived back in Montreal I called BA Customer Services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket, and that I could get a refund, if not for the new flight, then for the $400 of the flight I missed. Imagine my shock after spending an additional $1500 CAD all in. When I escalated my complaint, they did not address my case for over a month and once they did they just said we cannot refund you, and that was that.",1/10
134,"""Club World cabin very cramped""","✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to London Heathrow on B777 in Club World. This was an interesting comparison as we had flown out to HK on an A350 on Cathay Pacific and the difference was huge. The BA Club World cabin is very cramped when compared with Cathay. The seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very cramped. The duvets and blankets come in a bag that is in the seat area, which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off, this is fare enough but there is little room. They also provide bottle of water, which is great, but again little storage area. The food service was also disappointing, the duck breast as my main course was very tough. Drinks selection was very good. Plus points go to the cabin crew, who were very professional and had a sense of humour. Understand BA plan to change the business class seating in 2019 and this cannot come soon enough.",5/10
135,"""a solid performance""","✅ Trip Verified | London to Sao Paulo. Overnight club world flight. Prompt check in at Heathrow and into lounge. No spaces at the spa, Galleries lounges were fine and showers clean. Good WiFi. Aircraft was a 777-300 so in flight entertainment was good. They also had WiFi on board. Crew experienced and were good. Service prompt, food reasonable and I liked the new White Company offerings. Flight arrived early. Generally a solid performance.",8/10
136,"""Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats""","✅ Trip Verified | Premium economy worse than most airlines economy. Unprofessional staff, uncomfortable seats, foot rest but no leg rest, very little seat recline and difficult to operate. Rubbish food, very poor landing and everything went flying. Additionally, we were a family of 4 travelling together but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people. These “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos. Other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light - not BA. Even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup. This was the second leg on a flight from Sydney (via LAX) so we were beyond tired. When an attendant picked up my son’s water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight, he didn’t hear my son say “thanks” (which he had) so the attendant said pointedly “You’re welcome - rude!” and laughed about it with the passenger next to him. In my experience, better (and cheaper) premium economy can be found with Norwegian, Air New Zealand and American Airlines - all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge. I’ve never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with British Airways, I’ve never had a good experience.",1/10
137,"""well below BA's competitors""","✅ Trip Verified |  Fort Lauderdale to Gatwick. An efficient courtesy bus took us from car rentals (terminal 1) to the international terminal (terminal 4). Check-in was friendly. Security staff insisted on using a whole-body scanner for everyone and were overly officious. Surprisingly, there was no business class lounge, although there was plenty of sitting space before the gates in the redeveloped terminal. Boarding was according to group rather than priority which caused some annoyance. Club World was in two smaller cabins, with the usual, outdated eight seats abreast. Take-off was on time. The wrong menus had been loaded, so the actual menu was announced over the tannoy. Drinks and food service served efficiently. Food adequate and not overcooked, but below the standard of Turkish Airlines. Seats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping, with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seat. Abbreviated breakfast (no hot option) served an hour before landing. Arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule. Overall, an adequate flight, but the inflight experience was well below BA's competitors.",6/10
138,"""regret choosing BA""",✅ Trip Verified | Hyderabad to Brussels via London. Didn't expect this from British Airways. For me quality hit the rock bottom. Especially the unclean flight. I would have preferred the aircraft from Brussels to London and vice versa for the long haul travel. Maybe my expectations was too high but considering the price I paid for ticket I think it's not worth it. Other airline which I used to travel had the same price and if I compare the services of that ariline I regret choosing British Airways.,2/10
139,"""cabin staff were almost robotic""","✅ Trip Verified | Food on this 4+ hours flight from Moscow to Heathrow was a filled roll and 1 cup of tea/coffee. The other London-Moscow flights provide a full meal. The cabin staff were almost robotic and programmed in the discharge of their duties with no interaction with passengers. When the flight touched down, it was 75 minutes before we disembarked, 6 British Airways flights that landed after us discharged their passengers whilst our flight waited first at a stand and then 15 minutes for an air bridge operator. My email to their CEO produced nothing except a plastic apology, even though the captain continually said we were waiting on find the guy responsible for stand allocation. Used to be BA was a world leader. They've followed the empire and dinosaurs into extinction.",3/10

I am a frequent traveller but this was the first time I have traveled with British Airways and it did not disappoint me.

The seat aren't the most comfortable for a long haul flight but the value for money is good too.,6/10
141,"""so much for a full-service airline""","✅ Trip Verified | Flew short haul business class with British Airways, Manchester - Gothenburg via London Heathrow. It's a diffcult one to review, some aspects of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable. We used points to travel, so what we paid was fine, though would never pay a full BA business short haul fee. We have family in Sweden so took 70kgs (gifts etc) of luggage with us for our four night trip. Check-in was fine both ends, all fights on-time (just about) and no luggage issues, a positive. The staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to email/publish our concerns. We had a mixture of fortunes with the catering MAN-LHR, nice cold meat platter (30 min flight). LHR-GOT three dried up finger sandwiches, no alternative offered, were told could not take from the M&S menu in economy either. One reason for this, because we ordered an asian veg meal once years ago and apparently this stays on the system. I was told to change my profile details on BA site - once home I looked it clearly says meal options - none, i.e. no special menu (confusing to say the least). Thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights. We were told in economy you had to purchase everything, even water, however if in an emergency tap water could be provided - so much for a full-service airline! Any newspapers also gone from business class. On LHR-GOT route there was no divide put up between business and economy, so a 'free for all' to the front toilet. Leg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (£21 for the frist row and £18 for the rest), which is ridiculous if you had paid £400 return. Lounges OK - preferred MAN to LHR (which is busy and looking worn already). The down-scaling of BA and the mix of pretending to be a full-service airline, but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on. The FAs were a saving grace, though rest assured, they are not happy. We'll use up our existing points, though definiately not our airline of choice.",2/10
142,"""cabin staff polite and friendly""","✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Hyderabad via London Heathrow. All flights left on time but the HYD-LHR one arrived an hour late. I literally had to run to find my way through Heathrow to to board my connection. As for the BA flights, I found the cabin staff to be polite and friendly and the food to be decent, served on china plates covered with napkins. Since I was awake most of the time, flight attendants checked multiple times (outside of meal hours) if they could get me anything. My only issue with meals is, on the HYD-LHR leg, lunch was served very late. It was almost 8-9 hours between breakfast & lunch. That kind of seems their standard practice: they serve food sometime after take-off and before landing. Toilets were maintained well in all 3 flights. However, I wasn't impressed by the seats in BA flights. I found them to be a bit narrow and not comfortable enough to sleep in because I also couldn't rest my neck flat down (which I could in the AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia). I also think it was a bit difficult for folks in window seats to move out by crossing over the passengers in isle seats, if they were old or not agile enough. The AA flight from LHR -> Philadelphia had Bose noise canceling headphones, while the BA flights had just regular ones. No big deal, but still.",7/10

144,"""pulling in the right direction""","✅ Trip Verified |  London to Bangkok. I was a bit apprehensive about flying BA Club World due to the bad reviews the airline has received recently. Boarding at Heathrow was well organised due to their group boarding policy. On board I offered a pre Champagne or water. Once airborne choose gin and tonic and cashew nuts. Meal pre ordered online. I found all three courses exceptional and very well cooked. The staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flight. I know BA Club Seats are not ideal, but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any Middle East airline I have flown with. Entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp, cannot see when lights are on in the cabin. Very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at BA. I also must commend BA for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in club. There rapid response and actions probably saved his life, I flew on 12 January. Well done BA, you are pulling in the right direction again.",8/10
145,"""need to roll out promised changes""","✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to London return – business to London and First back to Toronto all on Avios. Fast check in at Pearson with the usual friendly check in team. Fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins. BA (presumably to save money) have shut their lounge and gone to a 3rd party provider – Premium Plaza. Its frankly awful, no class or professionalism, with limited wine and spirits options, and cheap and nasty food piled high. Elevator music drove us mad, and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft - (what on earth are you thinking BA?) Fast boarding, though with fewer crew, the boarding service in club is fragmented. Late with Champagne, wash bag after take off etc. With only four crew working club, there just isn’t time to offer a quality pre flight experience. The new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages. We were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the back of the cabin, had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks. All choices were available but the food is just not club standard. Poor entrees, cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago. BA really need to roll out the new meal service quickly – how long does the new pilot service to New York have to last for?? Got some sleep, had an okay fast breakfast (passed on the vile looking egg and bacon muffin) with an early arrival and bags topping off a better than expected flight. Returning on first was one of my better experiences via the new First check in, fast track and Concorde lounge. Excellent service on boarding, a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available. Some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea. Dry sandwiches with mean fillings, but okay cakes and scones. Early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow bags (45 mins after landing). These were my first mixed fleet Biz and first class service experiences. The crew were young, and lacking experience / knowledge but make an enthusiastic, polite and smart. However, they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service. Long haul crew were cranky at times, but they would connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights. Flowers have returned to the first class bathrooms, and the slide in quality and cuts in service seemed to have stopped, but BA really need to roll out the promised changes faster to retain premium customers.",9/10

Aircraft was very dated, IFE poor, meal service average, no snacks, poor drinks service, crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmal. Seats on these aircraft which have not been refreshed are beyond threadbare and we’re outdated a decade ago. The meal service has taken a severe cut in recent years. To top everything off the crew couldn’t even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest - embarrassing! When you tell BA about a negative experience they’ll waffle on about how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint - absolute waste of time - don’t waste your money flying BA - I’ve had far more positive experiences on Ryanair.",1/10

First of all, our flight was two hours late which made me miss my connecting flight in LHR. However, the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with food-vouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the situation. However, there was no information on connecting flights in LHR. Once on the plane, the lack of free service during the flight was a big minus as it now really does not make a big difference if you are flying Ryanair or British Airways. Seats were okay but nothing outstanding - same with the crew.",4/10

It's becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between British Airways and the budget airlines. The only saving grace is that I've never experienced any issues flying out of or into T5. Noticeable cost cutting measures include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also, BA have removed a toilet in economy within their A319 fleet to make space for seats in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only one economy toilet, disgraceful. My flight to Berlin was busy and the line for the sole toilet existed throughout the duration of the flight meaning the flight attendants couldn't offer an efficient trolley service and involved a continual display of other passengers weaving in and out of aisle seats.

We passsengers were informed minutes before boarding plane of this change. I had planned to stay the night with a friend who was going to pick me up at the airport. At such an unsociable hour of the morning, I could no longer disturb her. I explained all this to BA, who advised me that a rep would help me find a hotel and I would be reimbursed. On arrival, I was brusquely told by a BA rep to go online and find my own accommodation. After a more than 5 hour delay, my phone had no battery life. I was left to borrow a fellow passenger's phone and search for the cheapest motel near the airport - miles away from where I should have been. It transpires BA knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight - yet sent passengers an email urging us to get to the airport even earlier. I wasted 5 hours at Gatwick (when I could have carried on working). Also had I known, would have tried to get on an earlier flight or postpone our journey. To top it all, when all 150 passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of Verona at 2.30 am - no taxis. BA had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clients. Further wait. Not only had I missed my dinner reunion, to my astonishment British Airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill, stating that they had after all got me to my destination. I hadn't even counted the extra taxi bills I incurred (£45) - but I did expect BA to reimburse the 50€ hotel as a goodwill gesture. Not impressed.",2/10

After reading very mixed reviews here, I also saw that BA were upgrading standards on flights to NYC in particular and was looking forward to my flight. Should not have been so optimistic, as this is still a business class that belongs in the 1980's. Aircraft was tatty to be polite about it, worn carpets, seat with various malfunctioning or broken items, washrooms grimy from the word go. Staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service, but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins I have flown when I have to pay for the ticket. BA talk a lot about their premium standards, but even when you pay to-dollar for business class the standards are well below even their US counterparts. Complete rip-off sums it up.",3/10
153,"""ashamed this is my national airline""","✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow to Dubai. This is a warning of what to expect from British Airways . If they continue to treat passengers this way I can see the airline very quickly getting into difficulty. The reply I got from the airline below just brushed all the issues I raised under the carpet. Living in Egypt for 10 years I became I frequent flyer with Egyptair. If I wanted to change the date of travel with them they only charged me £60. BA want to charge me over £500 and because I wanted to cancel my flight and go with a better airline they were only prepared to give me a £9.50 refund even though I would have given them over 2 months notice. This airline is on my black list, makes me ashamed to think this is my national airline, but never again will I book another flight with BA. There was no priority seat booking unless I paid another £38 extra. There was no priority boarding. I booked seat 23D but this was mysteriously changed at check in to 24E. BA emailed me to confirm a change in the booking but did not say what that change was. I did not make any changes. In premium economy I was wedged in like a sardine in a seat that is only 1"" wider than economy with a few inches extra leg room. Is this some kind of joke? I had to double check that I wasn't in economy as there is only one seat difference in a row. The tough chicken meal was diabolical. The cabin light over the bulkhead luggage bins was jammed on and would not go out so no sleep whatsoever. I really do not see the necessity for this light anyhow as the non smoking lights and tv screen light give emit sufficient light anyway. I ended up paying £300 extra for nothing and am extremely disappointed with this flight. A few days previously I flew premium Economy with Virgin Atlantic return from Barbados and the difference between BA and Virgin is worlds apart.",2/10
154,"""now becoming as bad as Ryanair""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Sofia. Cabin crew were kind. This is the only positive thing. British Airways are now becoming as bad as Ryanair! Onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of money even for a small bottle of water. When I booked my flight from Heathrow to Sofia, I was told I get a free checked in bag for my baby girl. A day before my flight I decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the phone told me I need to pay for checked in bag if I want one. I told him that there should be one included for my baby daughter but he said this is not true. I asked him to double check this and he said he already did so I had to pay for a checked bag (£30 each way) since I already had my suitcase packed. Next day, as I went to the check in at Heathrow, I was asked how many bags do I want to check in. I asked how many bags am I allowed to check in and the lady said I can check in two bags- one for my baby and the one that I’ve paid for the previous day. The thing is that I only had one suitcase since the guy on the phone told me I can only check one bag (if I pay for it first). After I arrived in Sofia, I rang British airways and explained everything, so they agreed they should refund the money they’ve charged me for the additional bag. They said they’ll refund the £30 for the London-Sofia flight the same day and the other £30 fee for the Sofia-London route in about a week time. A month later I checked my online banking and saw they’ve only refunded £30 for the outbound journey. I rang them and they’ve said they are sorry and they’ll refund the remaining £30 within the next 3 days. When I pointed that it should be fair and reasonable that I get a 20% discount voucher from my next flight price, they said this is something British Airways do not offer.",3/10
155,"""the experience was shameful""","✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to London Heathrow. The inflight entertainment was not working so no tv, video, music or radio. USB socket not working. Headphones not working. Customer service very poor. Cabin crew seemed to be unaware that they were carrying paying passengers upon whom their jobs depend. Food mediocre. There was no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew didn't bother to fetch any. Tea served with breakfast was luke warm and stewed. No refreshments supplied unless collected from the galley It took 2 days to get through to customer relations, many calls cutting off after 18 minutes +, others cancelled after going through options. I cannot recommend British Airways who in my case certainly did not fly to serve. The experience was far below expectations and definitely at the lower budget range for customer service. As the British flag carrier the experience was shameful, my last flight with this airline.",2/10
156,"""true case of rip-off BA""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Madrid in economy class. Late booking and quite an expensive ticket to fly from Heathrow. Online check in and no luggage to check in so airport process was okay. Boarding quite efficient. Cabin was dirty - carpets, table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight. Everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink, choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awful. Staff seemed to have real problems with all card payments, and became bad tempered towards those of us wanting to buy. I wouldn't have minded on a cheap ticket, but this was not a true case of rip-off BA in 2017. Will avoid if possible.",3/10
157,"""no further decline in service""","✅ Verified Review |  Toronto to London in Premium Economy and onto Oslo in Economy. Easy check in and in the lounge within 15 mins. The usual selection of dry sandwiches, and a chicken noodle soup (minus the chicken and noodle). The lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing away. Efficient boarding with sparking wine/soft drinks offered. Early departure, fast drink service and dinner before lights out. There was no breakfast (previously scrapped) with the cereal bar now also gone. Early arrival, a short wait for a shower in the North Lounge, followed by an ok breakfast. An early departure and an average flight on a A319. Long queues for the bathroom (only one now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats) with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink. Early arrival though a long wait for bags. Oslo to London on a A320 was verging on a farce, A full flight, selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space. The buy onboard came out quickly with one and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served. Service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to get either machine back into life, broke out the paper visa slips, took the cart back in, re-appeared 20 mins later so service started an hour into the flight. Little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases. The crew tried really hard, put a brave face on and kept going. The organisation and concept of the BA buy on board is a disgrace. Though a third party provides the food and card machines, the choice, stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce.  I don't understand why BA continue to struggle with this service as Easyjet, Ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act together. Early arrival and fast bags completed the flight. Final flight home to Toronto was good, the club lounge at the B gates remains quiet, clean and an oasis to relax and eat/drink before flying. The 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on time. At the gate, the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class. Service was really slow on boarding I had to ask for champagne, and the underwhelming bag of toiletries and shades only offered after take off. We pushed back over 30 late. No signs of life from crew for another 30 mins, though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart. The main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking (no dried gravy or potato around the edges). Afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scones and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic. Overall, the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements. The crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience. The desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times. Other than the farce of buy on board, I was pleased there appeared to be no further decline in service.",7/10

Cockpit announcements very informative. Flight on time, with ability to catch up for a delay at departure due to tech failure. In terms of hard product, I was a bit disappointed. The Premium economy cabin looks clean and smart but the seat is pretty hard and not so comfortable for a long night flight. Entertainment screen very slow to respond (happened to me to with another A380 from BA so means it's an issue with the hardware). Food is decent quality, but the presentation, at least in PE, could be improved. The luggage delivery has been a pain, 75 minutes from the landing to the delivery of the bags is too much, even for such a big airplane.",6/10

Drinks and nibbles out sharpish and refreshed without asking. Meal served quickly. Carpaccio of melon with a prawn, miso cod, not overcooked, wasabi mash and veg. Average dessert and cheese and crackers. Wine topped up regularly. Coffee in a mug. All through the flight staff looked after my nervous flyer wife and little four year old with great care and attention as well as the rest of the cabin. Priority offload and separate bus to terminal. Fairly quick passport control and bags coming onto the belt as we got through. The crew had been very kind and chatty with us and in good humor. Apart from delay in leaving Heathrow FAB.",9/10

Club Europe cabin was not really a business class cabin, but economy with the centre seat converted into a table. Other than a lack of leg room and reduced seat recline the cabin was fine. The meals served was very good with a simple starter, decent hot main course and tasty dessert. There was endless drinks and hot drinks available during the flight. The senior cabin crew looking after the cabin were very good and could not do enough for you. The cabin was clean in both directions. Boarding the plane both in London and Keflavik was straightforward.",8/10
162,"""positive first experience""","✅ Verified Review |  Florence to Bristol. A positive first experience and I will try to fly BA in the future. When I booked the flight for myself and my 11 and 13 year olds I was automatically allocated seats (no charge), 23kg of checked luggage included at no additional charge yet the flights still worked out the cheapest. A few hours before the flight, during online check-in, I noticed my daughter's name mispelt on the ticket. I telephoned BA's 24 hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within an hour and I received a call back with an update part way through the process (no charge and no hassle). All staff from customer services to ground staff to in-flight crew were friendly. Staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child. We were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight. On this flight to Bristol everything is included in your ticket. We had soft drinks but a couple in-front had G&Ts. Our meal was salmon with couscous, bread, cheese and a mint. On the way back there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken salad with a chocolate brownie. The meals were actually really nice. Both our flights did depart late for different and, what I believe were, unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out to Italy still arrived early. Some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody seemed concerned and it was passengers who hadn't got themselves to the gate that further held the flight up. I wasn't bothered which airline I flew with. My criteria were that I could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and BA came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight. My criteria will still exist but I will certainly be looking at BA first in the future.",10/10

Apart from removing food from their services and replacing it with Marks & Spencer buy-on-board menu, on that particular flight, they even managed to run out of food for those who were willing to pay. It was impressive to see so many passengers having and expressing the same opinion: next time we'll just fly another airline, that reflects that quality of service into the ticket prices. This came only a month after the major ""IT failure"" that grounded all BA flights for a weekend. The only thing they have left is safety - if they lose that, then it's over.",1/10

After the whole episode, I wrote an e-mail requesting compensation for the flight delay & my misplaced baggage. It's now July 2017 and I still have not gotten back my monies. Extremely poor customer service. Wrote e-mails twice chasing them for the refunds. They said they will check. That was more than a week ago and haven't heard from them yet. As for the flight experience, poor. They have become so budget that they do not even provide necessary toiletries like toothbrush for long haul flights. In-flight entertainment was also poor, very limited selection of movies.",1/10
166,"""endured rather than enjoyed""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Brussels return. Through work I have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a BA flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed, even in the premium cabins. If your timing is right the prices reflect this, that is before the “add-on’s”. So be prepared to get on last, be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row, and eat and drink before you board – unless of course you are happy to pay more. That way if you get an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up, it’s a win. Any flights longer than a couple of hours I strenuously avoid BA if I can - a shame because in some ways I grew up with BA (back in the days of BOAC and BEA). Having said that the flights to and from Brussels were OK in a full aircraft either way.",3/10

Half the entertainment did not work properly if at all. In short acceptable service. Flight left and arrived on time. However, BA should take note that for this route, Emirates were less expensive and would have offered an A380 offering on both legs. The reason for choosing BA was the fact it was a direct service.",6/10

Amenities practically non-existent and wrapped in cellophane, tube of toothpaste (if only the cap would open) could only fulfill brushing requirements for half a mouthful of teeth, no covers for the headphones. Totally inadequate for the money paid and shaming the word Premium Economy. Before I forget, the Boarding Service was confusing, calling colors Gold, Silver, Sapphire, etc. People just rushing the line and the staff losing their voice, screaming for order.

Food thrust at us not served! Everything rushed. No politeness in service. Drink choice not outlined just 'what do you want. If it were not for the flat beds overnight it is a total waste of money.

No one took charge of our situation, information filtered through Italian speaking passengers who sought help with staff from Iberia airlines. BA staff was gone after 6pm and we were shuttled to hotel and told a rep would give us further information at hotel. No one from BA was seen or heard from at hotel. Multiple calls by passengers to BA resulted in little to no assistance. Friday, May 19 passengers are shuttled back to airport where chaos has broken out because there is little assistance once again at BA counter. After 1 hour in line I obtain a boarding pass on a flight to London with connection to Los Angeles, however the BA desk attendant informs me that the flight out of Rome is late due to technical issues and I will once again miss the flight out to LA.

Flight information was outdated and impossible to this day to reach customer contact.",1/10
177,"""Overall very disappointing""","✅ Verified Review |  Antigua to Gatwick. Check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient (better than Gatwick) and although we had a slight delay at immigration, we were soon airside. The new lounge was really comfortable and although we didn't use it (it was dark when we were there) they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofa's etc. The bar was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food. Boarding was on time. On board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wife's TV nearly falling off its mounting. Fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious. Push back and departure was exactly on time. Within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange. Unlike the flight out, where there was a more relaxed atmosphere, the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles. The food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasoned and pretty tasteless. I can only assume that the object of their haste was to get everyone fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible. To be quite honest I felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and I almost expected them to say 'I want you to go to sleep now and I don't want to here a sound out any of you until the morning'! Now I know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc, but at the end of the day (or night) they are working and are getting paid to do so. In my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers, it would improve the flight considerably. Breakfast was OK although I seemed to be the only person trying the bacon rolls and after one mouthful I understood why. In a blind tasting I probably would have guessed I was eating rubber bands. We arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the baggage reclaim, our cases were waiting for us. Overall very disappointing and based on this flight I would not recommend BA.",3/10

The check-in was smooth which encouraged me that I had made the right choice. However on-board the ageing Boeing 747 nothing else was worth talking about, the food and the service are clearly working to a lower standard than I have previously had with BA. The space available was tight for me; an average sized man - I don't know how a larger and or taller person would manage. BA has lost two loyal customers, but at least they will squeeze more profit from those people who remain. On my next long-haul I will regretfully opt for an alternative airline.",1/10

Now the last flight always comes to a remote stand and the morning flight (boarding 6.15 for 6.50 flight) is onto a bus to a plane that is never ready and always departs late. Holidays in Madeira ended with me and mum sitting on the floor in a departure hall for 5.5hrs. I wrote to BA and got the big fob off. Add insult to injury and no food at all on the plane!

In over 30 years of flying I've never seen an airline deteriorate so quickly as British Airways has recently. I can accept that I now have to pay extra if I want to check in a bag, but to sit on a 'full-service' airline for over 2 hours without so much as a complimentary cup of water, really? Did I miss something, have they lowered their prices? No, they just want suckers like me to pay more for something that was (and still is at their prices) included in the fare. BA now offers all food and drinks for purchase but the service was so slow and by the time we'd almost reached our destination there was a bit of an argument with a passenger who'd ordered a hot sandwich, but because the payment machine wasn't working, they took the food back to the galley and left the passenger without. The atmosphere was pretty grim, it's been a few years since I've experienced such a miserable economy flight. That was probably Ryanair but they've really raised their game. British Airways was a great carrier, even a year or so back, but now it's really overpriced rubbish, and they don't make me feel welcome anymore. There are so many other options in Europe.",1/10
181,"""saved £10 for two bunch of flowers""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Newark. We had heard a lot about the BA First Class ""wing"" at LHR and after checking in we made our way through it - directly from the check in area. The security and screening area is prompt and you find yourself in the First of the BA 1st Class lounges. If you did not know about the more exclusive ""Concorde"" lounge you would probably plonk yourself down here - as the check in staff did not mention the better lounge. The first one was rammed - end to end and we negotiated our way around the bags and carry on luggage strewn all over the place. The Concorde lounge was half empty and we had breakfast in the dining area. It was okay. The lounge is long, long overdue for a refurbishment. The Boeing 777 was parked at the B terminal and we were shown to our seats by a friendly FA. Champagne was served and for once it was chilled. The cabin looked a little tired and I suspect the plane was one of the first to have New First. We had the new Liberty branded wash bags which was light years ahead of the tacky bags we had last December. No amuse bouche - and no flowers in the WCs. There were nine passengers in First - and with an average spend £3,000 - one way, the total revenue would have been circa £36,000. Well done BA, you saved £10 for two bunch of flowers in the loos and 9 x £5 for the amuse bouche - grand saving of the operating costs a massive £55. Lunch was chosen from the cheap tacky menus (Pizza Express is better quality) - and my eyes popped as I read the lead appetizer, and I quote: ""Loch Fyne Kinglas smoked salmon with Oscietra caviar, Burford egg, shallots, creme fraiche and chive cress."" Oh my goodness - Caviar. My excitement was short lived. I had caviar alright - but just five eggs. (Yes folks 5 eggs, not 5 grams) You had to laugh. The soup was horrible. The salad never arrived. The main cod fillet and cod cheeks was very good in indeed. Wine ok. FAs all fine. We landed ahead of schedule - and whoever landed the plane was a zen master pilot. I did not feel the plane touch the tarmac.",6/10
182,"""told snacks had been withdrawn""","✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to London Heathrow. Boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for all. The flight was packed full. The inflight entertainment system didn't work for the entire flight - this is a 13 hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push back nearly 14 hours. I have noticed that BA don't seem to care about IFE not working on BA0009 and BA0010 as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengers. The captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it wasn't the cabin crews fault, they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction. He explained that the system had overheated - well that calms things! I do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous BA0009 flight I never want to experience again, so I was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available, however I was told they had been withdrawn - I was not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry. I managed but remembered how well EVA air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals! The cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toilets. Passengers wanting the toilets had quite a struggle to push past them. I have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern. ie blocking doors? I also experienced sinus problems, pain and congestion which is I believe due to the air quality on Boeing 777 airplanes, the air being very dry with little humidity. I do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches, sinus pain and congestion. I only experience this after flying on 777's and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problems. The captain was on hand to apologise for disembarking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceable. I complained to BA and also emailed CEO Alex Cruze having been urged to do so by the crew. My email to the CEO was forwarded to customer services, no surprises there. Customer Services who replied quickly, investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacks. I was advised that the lack of IFE would be investigated by their maintenance team. They would not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but I didn't expect them to. By way of compensation I was given 3000 Avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers, they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where Avios are accepted! Frankly I am disappointed in both the flight and BA's level of compensation, I have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be done to improve the passenger experience on this route. The only way to check is to fly that route again with BA, do I risk it ? Therefore I will be looking at all options in the future including middle eastern airlines with a plane change!",3/10

(Gatwick’s Sunday morning check in scrum is awful). All BA cabin crew and ground staff very polite and helpful. Food very good outward. Slightly poorer quality of meat on return but that will be the Peru catering supplier. Cabin clean, but plastic partitions and carpets are looking a bit tired. IFE screens are old and small.

The seats, lounge food, aircraft cleanliness, on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines. My most recent flight back I took an aisle seat for a change. The flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. This is really quite irritating especially during meal service. No attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints. I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. I think BA don't care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you. British Airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment, or even extra magazines on the flight. They really don't appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class.",1/10
185,"""not a good first trip on British Airways""","✅ Verified Review |  The flight from New York JFK to London Heathrow was extremely uncomfortable, although the entertainment was quite good on the TVs, the food was horrible, plasticy tasting, and above all not tasty. The flight from Heathrow back to JFK had many delays, although this was out of anyone's control, it was very inconvenient and there was a terribly long wait to board the new plane (5 hours). At first we were told that we would be brought to a new plane as soon as possible, but almost an hour later here were many other delays and disappointments that we were notified about. The other passangers and myself should not have to wait for hours to get on a new plane. I wish the discomfort of the plane, bad food, and time of delays were reduced dramatically. So far, not a good first trip on British Airways.",1/10
186,"""turning BA into a low-cost carrier""","✅ Verified Review |  I am just sad to have to write this review. I changed from Lufthansa to British Airways more then 10 years ago, because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way. Mostly flying between Berlin, the US and in recent years very frequently Cape Town. BA had more modern planes, innovative products like a great (rather new) First Class, lie-flat seats in Business Class, a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom. Flying from Cape Town to Berlin in January to keep my Silver Status made me realise, that none of my initial reasons to choose BA still exists, with the exception of the great cabin staff, that I feel really sorry for. The owners hired Álex Cruz last year, a very experienced low-cost airline executive and he is doing the best he can: Turning BA into a low-cost carrier. Unfortunately. The result is a pity. No more service on short haul flights, reduced service, only paid snacks on long-haul, worn 747's to Cape Town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777's with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards. British Airways as a premium airline is lost. Realistically for year to come. Even with my status renewed, I don't think I will fly them again if I don't have to. Meanwhile I understand, that companies sometimes unterstand and correct their mistakes. I do hope BA will do so in the hopefully not to distant future - and keep their great staff on ground and on board.",1/10
187,"""does not value their customers""","✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Cape Town via Gatwick. On our 13 hour night flight I discovered that my seat was broken and could not recline. Spent 13 hours sitting upright while everyone around me was in a reclined position. Complained to crew but as they were unable to solve the problem they advised me to issue a complaint when I returned home to Amsterdam. This is exactly what I did. BA replied that it was unfortunate that i had a bad ecperience and offered me a GBP25 gift voucher as it woud be unfair to other passengers if they gave me more. What an insult! Its unfair that I paid the same price as the rest of the passengers, that's unfair. They do not want to communicatie with me anymore regarding this matter. Very arrogant and not customer friendly at all. I feel cheated. British Airways obviously does not value their customers. A GBP25voucher woud be adequate for a short trip during the day, but for a long overnight flight, its an insult. Sent 2 e-mails but they have decided they dont want to communicate anymore.",4/10
188,"""how much of a budget are they on now?""","✅ Verified Review |  Heathrow Terminal 5 is a great airport, dedicated to British Airways, the check-in service was not as fast as they say, it was normal. The BA staff on the ground were cheerful and happy to help. I was very excited to fly on the new Dreamliner from London Heathrow to Dubai, but my dreams were crushed within my first few steps onboard. First the IFE felt very old and not clear at all, something you'd expect on non-refurbished B777's. Choice of movies and TV Shows are pretty good so I can't fault BA on that. The seats are nice, the head rest is excellent and leg room is okay. Cabin Crew are lazy and just do not want to serve us, I was waiting more than 7 minutes for someone to come to my bright light hovering above my head. The food is okay (Your first meal) its hot and options were good, two meats and nothing more you could ask for on a plane. However and this is a big however, your second meal we were given a Breakfast Bar, that was disgraceful! How much of a budget are they on now? I thought maybe something happened to the food so they gave us Breakfast bars instead, but on the return journey we were given a cookie for Lunch, people were laughing and looking at their cookies in disgrace. I just can't believe how downhill BA has gone. It's incredible how the airline now charges for shorthaul flights too, I think they're running out of money. Unfortunately I booked my flights to Marrakech before this expereince, and I promise that would be the last time I fly with BA.",3/10
189,"""Air Canada next time""","✅ Verified Review |  Montreal to London Heathrow. Flight and service was cheap, except for the price. I expected better and this was not value for money. Advance seat selection is expensive, just plain gouging on top of ticket price. It is complimentary on Air Canada. Even with boarding pass pre-arranged, there is no Bag drop in Montreal, just one long line, British Airways BA staff. Air Canada next time.",1/10
190,"""experience was a bit shoddy""","❎ Unverified |  Flew Gatwick to San Jose, Costa Rica return with BA at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us. The flight out was a typically cramped Atlantic crossing, and my wife and I were separated and unable to sit together. The cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs. The food was average at best, and lots of options ran out during the flight. On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served. I thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average, such a shame that the Middle East carriers are so much better in virtually every way. Sad and disappointing.",5/10
191,"""how the mighty have fallen""","❎ Unverified |  Oh dear: cost-cutting on British Airways has led to them becoming an embarrassment. Flew Kuwait to Edinburgh via London. Aircraft are still comfortable, timekeeping is good, and information from the flight deck is always forthcoming. However, most of the cabin crew were ""mature"", and the food and drink offering is now minimal. Breakfast from Kuwait was eggs mixed with vegetables (no, not the omelette we used to have) plus mushrooms and potatoes both prepared as a mushy sort of tortilla: both looked like something you would spoon out of a tin for a baby. ""Lunch"" was a mars bar or similar. I did not bother with the ""buy on board"" stuff on the flight to Edinburgh - I get a better choice in the terminal when I get off the aircraft. The domestic flight back from Edinburgh to Heathrow had the most appallingly childish cabin crew I have ever seen on BA, giggling at each other during the safety demonstration - very unprofessional. The evening meal out of London back to Kuwait was more like a snack, with a smallish steak, three snap peas, three baby carrots (I counted the things), and another babyfood potato thing. ""Breakfast"" was a muesli bar. Sorry guys: a comment on this board that BA equals ""Budget Airline"" just about sums it all up. I have other choices from the Gulf back home, and next time I will be thinking about taking one of them: the only attraction with BA is the extra legroom in Premium Economy, the choice of entertainment, and the direct flight to Heathrow rather than having to fly down the Gulf and return. Otherwise, the epitaph ""how the mighty have fallen"" springs to mind.",7/10
192,"""experience was wonderful""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Chicago O'Hare and my experience was wonderful. There were a few problems checking in at Terminal 5 (there was an issue with some of the luggage belts at check-in running slow - never mind these things happen). We were given information about what was happening and staff were doing their best. Fast-track security was fast. Made my way to the lounge in South Terminal which was busy but I was able to find a quiet spot. Lots of food and drinks on offer but I stuck to water as I knew would be eating on the plane. Had to go to a gate in B terminal - this was my first time at Terminal 5 so asked how to get to the gate, very easy instructions given and transportation via the transit train. Boarding was easy although I didn't use the priority boarding service (my bad missing the announcement). I paid extra so I could pre-book my seat (63J) on the upper deck and really glad I did. Our cabin crew were wonderful, so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for them. The food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice! I managed to get a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me. There's lots of room and the upper deck is limited to a maximum of 20 passengers so it feels very private. The window seats have lots of storage but unless you are in 62 or 64 A/K you have to climb over your neighbour's foot stool/legs to get in and out of your seat. 63J is an aisle seat so less private but lots of room as it's by an exit door (ideal for anybody over 6ft). There is a long not too high drawer to place items (I put a pair of knee-length leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more) and there's the overhead lockers. I couldn't fault my trip out and I am hoping my return trip is just as enjoyable.",10/10
193,"""comfortable economy seat""","✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Cape Town. This journey was a very pleasant surprise. I didn't expect great service and was not disappointed. I didn't expect great food or wine and was not disappointed. I didn't expect a comfortable economy seat and was pleasantly surprised. This was an older 777 with a 3-3-3 configuration (31"" seat pitch) in economy and comfortable seats. I flew to South Africa this time last year with Virgin on their new B787 and it was a nightmare. The comfort of seat on a long haul is far more important to me that anything else and this was a far more pleasant experience than I had expected.",8/10
194,"""food had no taste whatsoever""","✅ Verified Review | Bangkok to London with British Airways. I'm a frequent flyer. For a change, we decided to fly BA to London from Thailand for our 12 hour journey. When we were seated, we realized that the seat cushion was coming away. Underneath there were lots of litter. We then realized that we can't watch movies etc due to fact that there was no sound. I informed the cabin crew and they said that they will report to relevant people etc. Our other complaint was the food - it had no taste whatsoever and was served with plastic cutlery which broke few times. In short I would not recommend flying with BA.",1/10
195,"""equal to Ryanair and EasyJet""","✅ Verified Review |  Leeds Bradford to Heathrow. Service is equal to Ryanair and EasyJet. I've been flying with BA regularly for last 4 years and I can't get my head around what is going on. Complimentary drinks replaced with a Buy on Board menu and the flight is so short not all passengers even get served now!  Really just appalling. There is no competition on the LBA route, but I certainly won't pay anything extra to travel with BA from now on if there are alternatives available - Ryanair it is at around a fifth of the price usually!",3/10
196,"""exceed my expectation""","✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Berlin Tegel. A good flight. Food is good for a short-haul flight in business class, but I note that there is no longer free snack and drink in Economy. Now they sell M&S stuff. But the question is whether it is worth the while flying business short-haul. I did only because it is one of my long haul segments. I expect nothing and it turn out to exceed my expectation.",8/10
197,"""Travel Nightmare""","✅ Verified Review |  Flew from Los Angeles to Nice via London Heathrow. 2 words: Travel Nightmare. Every leg of my British Airways flight was delayed including one which was delayed due to a ""paperwork issue that would take 10 minutes"". 2 hours later we took off. Late inbound flights caused me to miss my connection which British Airways charged me exorbitant fees and wait in a 4 hour line to rebook. Inflight entertainment audio system did not work properly, which was not resolved and offered no compensation as a result. By far the worst travel my wife or I have ever experienced, we will be avoiding this airline for life.",1/10
198,"""a par with low cost standards""","✅ Verified Review |  Madrid to London. Fairly chaotic check in, largely down to the Iberia staff. Boarding was quick and friendly welcome from cabin crew. Seats are cramped and on a par with low cost standards, cabin was reasonably clean. Flight crew gave good information. Inflight the crew started the new food and drink sales, and this was where the chaos started. The time they were taking for each row they served was excruciating. I was seated 9 rows back and gave up waiting for a drink and dozed off. Before landing I spoke to my neighbour and asked if they finally got served ... they said the sandwiches had all run out long before staff got them. This was not a cheap fare that I got, and British Airways state publicly that their customers asked for this new service, buy onboard etc. What a lie, I have yet to meet anyone who has been asked what they wanted in the many months before BA stopped any complimentary service. Sad to see our national airline has slipped well below the likes of Lufthansa and Air France.",2/10
199,"""worst customer service""","✅ Verified Review |  London to Phoenix with British Airways in Premium economy. Possibly the worst customer service and flight attendants ever, both outward and inward flight. The plane was dirty, old and smelly. The cabin crew were rude, unhelpful with their customer service who simply ignore your complaints. British Airways should stand for budget airline.",1/10
200,"""reduced to that of a budget airline""","✅ Verified Review |  St Petersburgh to London. I don’t know where BA got this market research to say stop complementary meals, we prefer to pay for it ! I’ve yet to find anyone who agrees with this idea and certainly no one asked me for my opinion. If you want to buy something different, you always have the option in the endless airport shops before boarding. I suggest they look seriously at their market research company if this is true, though I suspect the real reason is cost cutting, BA just doesn’t want to admit it. BA would be better off to admit it, customers would have more sympathy than trying to promote this policy as some benefit to the customer when clearly they are removing benefit and keeping price the same, we can all see through the attempted deception and it does the image no good. To tell me that charging £1.80 for water or soft drink is a bargain when I can buy the same thing in Tesco for 63p insults my intelligence, they are exploiting the fact that passengers cannot carry liquids through security so they have a captive market, again a great image to promote to the world. Where possible myself and family will now actively seek to avoid being a BA passenger where any alternative exists. Pay extra for checked luggage, Pay extra for drinks, pay extra for food, I’m sorry to see our flag carrier in such a state that it is reduced to that of a budget airline.",2/10
201,"""we don't deserve the shoddy treatment""","✅ Verified Review |  
This latest British Airways trip from London Heathrow to Dallas Fort Worth just confirms how standards are slipping. Background: family living in USA = regular leisure transatlantic flyer, in the last 10 years consistently booking for 2-3 travellers on each trip, regularly flying Business for eastbound transatlantic leg. To date transatlantic travel (over 30 years) has been exclusively with British Airways. Service has been almost consistently good or very good. We may not be Gold or Silver members, but we don't deserve the shoddy treatment this most recent booking received. 1) Original booking for outbound LHR-DFW leg was booked by BA agent over the phone in the wrong category/class, even though it was made clear we wished to purchase an upgrade (cash or airmiles) at a later date. Subsequent phone calls over the next few months were a farce, with consistently inconsistent responses - when we eventually managed to get through. The Executive Club customer service link just sends you round in circles! A formal emailed complaint through ""Contact us"" resulted in ""we're sorry to hear you've had problems"" - but no solution offered. Teeth gritted and traveled. 2) 9.5 hour flight LHR-DFW departing 1030. Refreshments/drinks served 1130ish before lunch. 9year old daughter hungry, no nibbles. When asked, steward responded ""well, that's cutbacks for you"". Pre-ordered child's meal arrived 1230, before standard adult meals. No problem. Juice and water were available during the afternoon. No snacks available for children for 5 hours! ""Cutbacks"". Luckily I had a packet of shortbread (as a gift for friends in USA). At 1830 cabin service (tea) started. When I asked for daughter's pre-ordered child's meal, conversation with stewardess went thus - ""Why didn't you order one?"" ""I did!"" ""She didn't have a child's meal at lunch"" ""Yes, she did!"" ""Oh well, I'll check when I've finished serving the main cabin"" Really? We were only in the 3rd or 4th row - would it have been too much effort to check then? Clearly yes it would. And when she did check some 20 minutes later, there was no child's meal - so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused child's lunch, very ungraciously. No hint of an apology. Customer service? Customer satisfaction? Result: continued loyalty for transatlantic flights? What do you think?",3/10
202,"""1 hour in the horrific queue""","✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Las Vegas via Manchester. I went to the trouble of checking in online, printing boarding pass etc and expecting to just drop my bag at the airport, to be told that is not allowed! I was told I had no option but to queue up with everybody else checking in. After 1 hour in the horrific queue, I am told there is ""no space for a bag drop at Manchester T3"". The agent said this with 4 empty check-in desks next to her. British Airways disgust me with this hoop-jumping checking in online which only serves the airline and left me in agony on my feet. Thank you for the complimentary micro-bag of crisps on the delayed LHR-MAN leg! If I never see BA/AA ever again it'll be too soon.",1/10

I was looking forward to my first flight with British Airways thinking that they were a leading airline. In my view they are nothing special. I was looking forward to a nice breakfast before landing back at Gatwick from Mexico. We were given a cheese roll, yoghurt and a cereal bar. I couldn't eat the cheese roll as it was so bland, ate the yoghurt and saved the cereal bar for my 2 hour drive home. Okay, I got a good price and flew economy but that's exactly what I got - a flight that seemed to focus on economy. I would be happy from now on to pay more for another airline.",5/10

A nice plane, good IFE with wide modern screen. Seats were fine although storage lacking compared to A380. Food still a letdown . Chicken served in kebabs but far too sweet and soggy. White wine good red poor. Breakfast scrambled eggs and steak! Spoilt by having a greasy liquid in the bottom of tray rendering pretty well inedible. I got a decent sleep.",7/10

I haven't flown British Airways for around 10 years, and with work I usually fly either middle-eastern or Asian airlines, what a contrast! I doubt BA have changed anything in that aircraft in the 10 years since I last flew. The TV screen is just 6in low resolution with a very small number of ok films available, nothing of interest with the music either. Food was quite tasty but small portion, no side salad. Drinks (other than water) were only offered at meal times. Seats are so narrow - I paid extra for the emergency seat ($85!) after reading how narrow the seats were, a wise decision, but I shouldn't be paying extra as all middle-east and Asian airlines I have flown have bigger seats, better food choice, better entertainment - how can they offer such a poor service?",2/10

Quite enjoyable flights both ways with first-rate leg-room (38in in WTP vs 31in in regular WT remains a strong positive point with me), some of the best airline cuisine I've had in recent years, an excellent pre-meal drinks service including Tribute Cornish ale, on-time departure/arrival and the attentive, courteous cabin-crew service I've received through the years from British Airways. (Two tiny flyspecks though - no more newspapers on boarding and no nibbles with the drinks service, but nowhere nearly enough to ruin the overall trip.) This remains my favourite way of flying between the USA and Europe. I am a regular Skytrax reader and note the numerous negative reviews BA's regular tourist-class service has latterly received in this forum (haven't flown it myself in a couple of years though), but on this and other recent showings BA's World Traveller Plus premium economy remains as good as ever.",10/10

He doesn't like curry so it was whispered to him that he could have a veggie meal. Same at breakfast - served half hour early so had to eat alone. When other breakfasts came out, guess what no meat. On complaining to BA Customer Services, told could choose another meal if we had gone on line and paid extra.

208,"""the service was merely adequate""","What a disappointing experience flying British Airways from London Gatwick to Mauritius. Flew club class and the service was merely adequate, they did what they had to do and no more - at no point we were made to feel valued customers. A request for a cup of tea after dinner, resulted in no tea brought (it was allegedly given to another passenger), when we had fruit as a dessert, it was given with no plate, bread at breakfast was also given without a plate - had to be put directly onto the tray. On the flight out the new film releases advertised in the onboard flight magazine, weren't available to view. Given that we paid a lot of money for these tickets, the service given was very poor and the flight attendants not overly friendly. BA now seems to be a budget airline with regard to service and amenities but premium in price. Flew Emirates last year to Mauritius and there is no comparison. Emirates wins hands down. BA needs to get its act together as it will loose customers.",3/10

The lounge at Marrakesh is a joke with only a few seats and very limited choice of drinks - 2 miniature bottles of wine between approx 20 passengers. However the flight itself was good with nice meal and champagne. The cabin service manager was great going around offering drinks frequently for a 3 hour flight this was brilliant. The flightdeck kept us updated during the flight. My only other issue would be my baggage was marked with priority but was one of the last to come off.,7/10

Economy Class complimentary service will end soon. Cabin crew was just OK, but I’m giving 2 stars because they can’t be much greater than the level of services provided. Our luggage was delayed 45 mins at Heathrow Terminal 5. BA now offering low-cost airline standard - the only difference is price, it's more expensive which makes poor value for money. I'm still using BA regularly and I can see the obvious downgrade in standards during the last 2-3 years and even more dramatic decline in 2016.

During the flight the cabin crew were professional doing their duties. All friendly and welcoming. Food wise we only got complementary biscuits - a little bit of a let down - but on a short flight like this totally understandable. Drinks were fine, got the normal selection: Coke, coffee, juices etc. On the return flight it was slightly different. They seemed to have less in stock not only in the food department but also the inflight shop. Disappointed in this as what I wanted to buy wasnt avaliable.But on this return flight the positives outweigh the negatives. Flight crew again amazing. All kind and welcoming like the first flight.

The seat was comfortable with ample legroom, the food was excellent for airline food and both ground staff and flight crew were friendly and efficient. The flight was quiet and smooth, on time and made up time on the flight. The only downside was that the inflight entertainment stopped working after one hour, despite the crews efforts it could not be restored for the remainder of the flight. We did note one steward enter the premium economy cabin with a list and upgraded about 15 people into business, the rest of us went without for 8 hours.

The starter consisted of 6 tasteless pasta spiral and 1 cherry tomato. The fish was dry and tasteless and the rice an unappetising grey colour. The dessert was a square of plain cheesecake. Hot beverages at breakfast were served in thin paper cups. There was no other service, no offer of water or snacks between the meals. Toiletry consisted of hand wash and nothing else. The toilets were not cleaned and replenished during the stop over in Singapore. The seat was comfortable enough but has only a foot rest rather than the leg rest of other airlines.

Passengers were hungry and cabin staff were clearly embarrassed with the megre offering. For our national carrier to go to this low base and makes a mockery of 'To fly-to serve'. We will choose any other airline over British Airways in future - human cargo are clearly an inconvenience for the BA management (although the cabin staff did their very best).

220,"""not fit for purpose""","✅ Verified Review | Here I am again after my previous review 2 weeks ago of specifically the British Airways online check in system. I am currently in Cyprus on holiday and will be flying back to London this evening with my elderly Mother. We sat next to each other last night at 1930 and opened our BA apps on our phones at the same time. My Mother had a choice of 12 seats (on a 300 seat Boeing 767), and I had a choice of just 4 seats. Again. So clear evidence of passenger inequality at BA, even though the passengers are travelling in the same cabin class. This happened 2 weeks ago when flying from London Heathrow to Larnaca. Firstly, why do I, who flies several times a year with BA, only get 4 (very poor location) seats to ""choose"" from, and another BA Economy passenger gets a choice of 12 seats to choose from? Secondly, why do BA offer an online check in service which is not fit for purpose? When I fly with Aeroflot, you can choose your seat at the time you actually book your tickets. As it should be with every airline. But BA appear to suffer from some kind of 'seat hoarding' issue for some reason. I presume they would rather people pay the £15 to choose a seat in advance on top of the already high price of their tickets, something I personally will never ever do.",2/10
221,"""cabin crew were polite, friendly and efficient""","We flew from Heathrow to Kos on Tuesday 13th September departing at 07.25. As the flying time was between 3.5 and 4 hours long, we had contemplated flying Club Europe but with identical legroom to the economy seats, it didn't seem worth the money. We checked in around 05.15 and having previously paid to reserve our seats, everything went smoothly as most of terminal 5 seemed very quiet. I had tried to find out in advance what food (if any) might be offered on the flight as we would have preferred not eat breakfast at 06.00 in the terminal. However, despite knowing people that work for British Airways, it seemed quite difficult as the web site is rather ambiguous. Having said that, I did find out that the food offered depends on what band your flight is classified as but try as I may, I couldn't find the LHR to Kos on any of the bands. In the end we had tea and toast at Gordon Ramsey's which was expensive but a lot quieter than the other outlets serving breakfast. Boarding was on time although we did have to catch a bus to somewhere near terminal three which took around 10 minutes. The plane seemed little more than half full which obviously speeded up boarding and we left a little early. The cabin crew were polite, friendly and efficient and we were offered a sandwich and a drink for breakfast, which was fine. As we had a spare seat in our row of three, it effectively meant that we had the same space as Club, which made the flight a little more comfortable. We arrived a little early in Kos after a slightly bumpy landing but we were through customs and had our bags within half an hour. Overall a good flight and BA must have a tough job selling their Club Europe seats unless of course passengers want to, pay hundreds of pounds for lounge access and a hot breakfast.",9/10
222,"""food tasty and staff friendly""","One way, London Heathrow to Amsterdam with British Airways. Flight itself was good. Food tasty and staff friendly. This is a short flight and the flight attendants have a lot to do in a little amount of time, so they can be forgiven for being seemingly hasty. The only complaint is the incredibly crowded lounge. Lockers in the lounge would be a great improvement, especially for solo travelers.",8/10

Used my card to access the BA Lounge at T3 which is pretty average, although enjoyed a good supper with very good claret so did not need to eat on plane. Boarding a bit of a mess at remote gate 35 where both the PA and aircon were not working, but nonetheless everyone seemed to be seated before the inevitable missing passenger/bag offload, which caused a 30min push back delay. Service seemed efficient on board (although I did not eat dinner) and we had a friendly young crew member on our aisle. Managed to get some rest and with enjoyed breakfast before landing at CPT, 30 mins late. All in all, reasonable value for money.

Seat comfortable, pitch on the small side. Business class bus transport to LHR terminal 5 main building.",8/10
225,"""Club Europe seats are a joke""","I flew British Airways Club Europe, from London Gatwick to Malta International Airport. I don't know why we paid double the economy fare per person as the seats are exactly the same as economy class apart from the lavish table in the middle of the 2 seats. You get a blanket, a cushion and nicer food than economy and access to the lounge, which comes with my Barclays travel deal anyway. I enjoyed the food on the plane but my sisters friend who flew with us is a pescetarian which means she only eats fish and not meat, so the crew said that's no problem and gave her a disgusting baguette with tomato, but she didn't like it and there was no other choice for her. Complete waste of money but I loved the chocolate cake - the best I've had. To conclude the BA club Europe is a waste of money because the seats are exactly the same as economy class and your paying to travel in more comfort and luxury. The Club Europe seats are a joke.",3/10
226,"""doesn't cut the mustard any longer""","✅ Verified Review |  
I have to be upfront and say the flight from London Heathrow to Boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew. Over the years British Airways first has gone so far downhill I'm afraid it just can't compete anymore, it needn't be so as the issues as I see them are all resolvable. However, the return leg was like flying with Ryanair. There were only 13 people in the cabin. There were no slippers, 2 of the menu items I requested were, in the words of the crew ""invisible"", and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm. The chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me. My father waited the entire flight, having asked on 3 seperate occasions, for a headset convertor. We were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast, which I then missed assuming I would be woken. There was a palpable tension between the crew, which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers. Once we had disembarked the aircraft, it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked. Finally, we collect our suitcases, which I have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim, only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. BA have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. When comparing the service / food to Virgin UC for USA and Etihad First for east bound, BA just doesn't cut the mustard any longer I'm afraid. Such as shame as the seats / bed are great, but why pay the extra £ for service and food that just isn't forthcoming or varies from flight to flight?",5/10
227,"""choice between a mini Kitkat or a mini mars bar""","✅ Verified Review |  Abuja to London Heathrow. This flight took off and landed on time. The jack on the new style headphones didn't fit in the socket, so if I wanted to listen to anything I had to sit and hold the jack in place. There was no toothbrush or toothpaste included in the little package left on seats for customers. The meal served before landing was a choice between a mini Kitkat or a mini mars bar. A far cry from the scone, jam and cream of a couple of years ago - and even worse than the bruschetta, mini breadsticks, tomato salsa, packet of mixed nuts and 2 celebrations of a couple of months ago. Don't even get me started on the disgusting muffin that has replaced the salmon and egg roll as the meal before landing on the outward journey! The toilets were not checked as often as they should have been and I had to inform the cabin crew that there was no toilet roll left. Very disappointing.",3/10

British Airways have the temerity to call blocking out a middle economy seat with a metal tray Club Europe! The seats were narrow and uncomfortable economy seats. The flight attendant was grumpy, rude, and sullen. I accept this was a short flight, but how British Airways get away with calling this Business Class is beyond me. They should be cited for trade descriptions. I wonder if any BA senior executives bother to fly their so-called Premium Classes?",1/10

Flight left on time. A380 Club world layout was roomy. However, slightly inferior cabin service, for example no hot towels, no drinks menu etc. Food quality was good. The club world kitchen content was poor and inadequate, when I visited they had only ice cream on offer. Seat comfortable and slept well when used as a bed. Baggage damaged on arrival. Overall, a reasonable flight. A superior product compared to North American carriers. However, inferior in comparison to middle eastern airlines.",7/10
230,"""Shocking customer service""",✅ Verified Review |  We travelled from Aberdeen to Heathrow and on to San Francisco with no issues other than very poor legroom. Even less legroom than on a local flight to Europe (Ryanair) on a 10 hour flight. On the return journey the first flight from San Francisco to Heathrow was delayed. Once on the plane the flight was ready to go when there was a further delay because the gate staff had somehow mixed up the boarding passes and had a discrepancy. So they had to physically check several passengers to make sure they were who they said they were. Very scary in view of the security situation. Then our row of 3 seats had no in-flight entertainment (row 28) The first flight attendant we talked to fobbed us off for ages and eventually admitted he could not fix it. Then the next level up flight attendant tried and finally the flight director came to see us and offered us an alcoholic drink. So we travelled for 10 hours with no entertainment. On landing at Heathrow our next flight to Aberdeen was also delayed for one hour. On complaining to BA they eventually replied offering us a voucher for 20 pounds. Not much use if you intend never to fly BA again. Shocking customer service. Avoid Heathrow and particularly BA at Heathrow.,1/10
231,"""extremely disappointed""","I'm extremely disappointed with British Airways and how their service has diminished. My daughter arrived at Milan airport today to catch a 6am flight to London Heathrow and then connecting to Mexico City. She is still at the airport after 12 hours. The fligth to London was cancelled. There was only one person at the counter in Milan and no employee told any of the passengers about the flight cancellation. Customers were furious, screaming at the lonely representative, because British Airways was not giving any answers or solving the problem. My daughter missed her flight, was not offered a meal, a hotel room and only given the option to fly with Iberia through Madrid and then connect to Mexico City. Her bag was sent to a distant belt and was never told she had to pick it up and retrieve her luggage. This has been a total disaster. I had also paid for a good seat on her long flight to Mexico City, and now I will have to write and complain and wait for a refund. British Airways was an excellent airline, until suddenly everything changed. On my last trip my bag never arrived at Heathrow, I was given a short connection time therefore I lost my next flight. I encountered a very rude lady at the customer service counter and I had to stay at Heathrow to get the same flight 24 hours later. I will never use them again until they improve or change their service.",1/10
232,"""all in all not bad""","Zurich to London Heathrow with British Airways. The lounge at Zurich was fine. Reasonable selection of food and booze albeit a shared lounge. Given the number of flights on this sector one wonders why BA could not have a small personalised set up. But we are talking about BA where nothing is ""normal"". Flight was rammed. I doubt if you could get a field mouse on the plane it was so full. The plane left 25 minutes late - but with a couple of gin and tonics on the way I could not care less. Seats, the usual cramped 3 into 2 configuration that is unique to BA regional business class. A lousy set up. FA's were very friendly and provided great customer service. I complained about the high numbers of economy passengers hijacking the Club Europe WCs. I am not a snob by any means - but given I paid about £450 - one way for the ticket, surely ease of use for the loo is not unreasonable. FAs were sympathetic and I filled out a complaint card. All in all not bad, apart from the miserable seat and not being able to get off the plane quickly.",8/10
233,"""could not check our luggage through""","✅ Verified Review |  My wife and I used Avios to get two return tickets from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. After having done this, and once our business travel plans were clear, we later booked a separate ticket using cash for a return from Edinburgh to London Heathrow. When we checked in at JNB, we were told we could not check our luggage through to EDI because the two sectors were on different (but still BA) tickets. Apparently this rule was (very quietly) introduced by British Airways on 1 June. The flights themselves were very good, but if they want to encourage two Gold card holders to use other airlines, they are going the right way about it.",3/10
234,"""flight was late and chaotic""","✅ Verified Review |  For those who have alluded to there being ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" on BA flights in terms of customer service I can assure them this is not the case. I am a gold executive club member and can confirm that I have invariably been treated with equal levels of contempt as a customer at all levels of their executive and club and most cabins. My last experience was with my wife flying from London Gatwick to Faro on the 18 May 2016. Checked in at the first counter for our economy flight to be told by the apparently gleeful BA employee that the plane was rammed so we knew we would be in for an uncomfortable flight. The lounges that are available whilst the BA lounges are renovated were packed and filthy. The BA lounge greeter offered no apology when we couldn’t access the clubrooms that were full. The flight was late and chaotic. A group of loud boisterous men, were virtually running the economy cabin, roaming the cabin whilst the seatbelt signs were on and raiding the galley to return with clutches of mini wines and spirits. This resulted in my Wife being told they had run out of gin and tonic. It turned out to be a lie when the Purser emerged from club to serve one of the other passengers with a G&T on a tray. Returned home 10 days later and complained. Received a jumbled response. Cancelled all non essential flights with them in the future including high yield club world flights and will only use them when forced - they didn’t seem to care so good luck to them.",1/10
235,"""food was just appalling""","✅ Verified Review |  I would have been very disappointed indeed if I had paid a full fare for my business class ticket. The food was just appalling. I could hardly get two mouthfuls our of my starter and the main course (beef) was hard, tasteless and very small. Compared to business class meals in say Cathay Pacific or Qatar Airways, portions on both starter and main were around 50% less. Incredibly, British Airways serve such mean meals in business class on a transatlantic route, where they make most of their money, I was hungry after the meal so later on decided to 'raid the larder' but they only had sweet, which I generally avoid. The menu states there would be yoghurt and other stuff there they were not available. The FAs were embarrassed and got me some cheese. Plus were excellent service, good selection of IFE and comfortable enough seats (a larger pillow would do), although I hate having to climb over someone to get out of my seat. British Airways revamped Iberia after they merged but now Iberia has a much better business class product.",3/10

When we arrived at check in we were advised the flight had been over booked and we would have to go on stand by. When we asked how can this be, we were advised by a manager that all airlines do this and check the small print. We stated as these flights had been bought and paid for over 6 months previous, so wanted to know how BA could re sell our seats, manager just kept repeating company policy. Manager stated we had to stay on stand by. As things turned out we did get stand by seats at the very last minute. I am appalled with the way this was handled and will not be using them again - buyer beware.",3/10

My only complaint is that lunch was served at 4pm London time followed by tea at about midnight. Why not tea after take off and dinner at say 8?",9/10
238,"""poor customer service""","✅ Verified Review |  My partner and I were flying from London Heathrow to Bombay in March and were due to catch an onward flight to Goa. Unfortunately someone fell seriously ill on the flight and our plane was redirected to Istanbul to allow for them to be taken to a hospital. The redirection meant that we arrived in Bombay 3 hours late and wouldn't make our connecting flight. When we touched down in Bombay the flight attendants said that BA ground staff would help us with missed flights, connections etc, and we should speak with them when we disembarked. On this advice we sought out uniformed BA ground staff in the luggage hall and asked for advice on what to do. They advised us to exit the hall and find an airport-based travel agent and purchase new flights to Goa. When we voiced our concerns about not being reimbursed they reassured us saying that BA would definitely cover it, and went on to say that we should wait 14 days before making a claim through the website. Armed with this advice from BA staff we went ahead and purchased new tickets. Big mistake. Since returning home we have duly followed instructions and tried to claim for reimbursement. Here is the reply we received from BA customer relations: ""We've received a reply from Mumbai who've investigated your case. The agent you spoke to can't specifically remember speaking to you personally. He did mention he'd advised customers with separate tickets to make their own arrangements. He also mentioned BA wasn't responsible for any onward travel costs."" This is an outright lie. I can only conclude that the BA staff member we spoke with in Bombay was either fobbing us off or was improperly instructed in what to say to customers. Either way British Airways should be held responsible for the advice their staff give. Poor service at the time and poor customer service in the follow up.",5/10
239,"""erosion of quality and services""","There are many negative reviews on this site - its almost embarrassing to admit to flying BA. I am adding another one. I have flown BA on/of for 37 years. I guess that makes me qualified to write a review. My main gripe is the total lack of value for money. The erosion of quality and services and the sky rocketing prices. This flight from Heathrow to Barcelona and the return - accentuates the lack of value. Barcelona flights operates out of Terminal 3 at LHR. Quite why BA use this ageing and outdated terminal is a mystery. You walk miles and if you are unfamiliar with this point, as we were, - you end up running a panicked race to the gate. Its worse on arrivals. Immigration and passport control was a zoo.  The T3 Business lounge is mediocre, Plastic tables and chairs. The most awful selection of dried out bacon baps and dried out omelettes stuffed into baguettes. The seating areas overlooking the airport was cluttered with newspapers. There was plenty of booze. Flight left on time. The meal inflight I could not be bothered with. FAs all fine. On the return the shared lounge was surprisingly good. More comfortable than T3 at LHR. Ageing plane. Mediocre afternoon tea. Frumpy FAs who ""forgot"" to hand out our Fast Track tickets to help speed up through immigration. (We got held up for half an hour.)  On both flights we had to endure the silly Club Europe seats - basically two seats - with the middle seat closed down into a table. Cramped leg room. Definitely no value here. I only fly BA when I have to. It really needs a clean out of the management and a new team with some vision on how to make British Airways a world leader - which right now they fail miserably to achieve, in all their cabins.",2/10
240,"""operated by American Airlines""","Pisa to Chicago via London Heathrow. This route is one that I have done many times. Bought my ticket using British Airways miles and their part of the trip did not disappoint. The flight from Pisa to London Heathrow on an A320, was flawless. The check-in was normal, flight was fine, there were IFE and food and beverages served. I proceeded to my next flight, which was operated by American Airlines. Boarding was on time, which is the only positive thing about this flight. The seats are old, IFE had no selection of movies, when I searched for action and adventure there was only one film! How was I supposed to stay entertained on an 8 hour plus flight if there aren't any movies? The food was awful, and the best thing I can say is they gave lots of drinks. The food didn't sit well on the stomach, and trying to drink an alcoholic beverage just made it worse. I ordered a vegetarian meal, and was served a very bland and flavorless pasta. When breakfast was served I was given the same dish. The crew was careless and seemingly did not want to hear about my problems. There was no way to sit comfortably and I dreaded the flight since the moment my foot stepped aboard the plane. Arrived ahead of schedule, another positive thing. Once I cleared security I found that there is a British Airways flight, actually operated by British Airways, that arrives at the same time. Next time I fly this route with them I will make sure to not get an American Airlines leg, especially long haul. Truly unpleasant experience for the most of my journey.",5/10
241,"""reminded me of the old BA""","Flew Toronto to London in British Airways club world on avios and companion voucher. Prompt check in at Pearson with friendly staff. The club lounge is well run with dinner served as this is a sleeper service. A good choice of food though though the wine list remains unimaginative. The lounge is too small when busy. Additional toilets are needed - too few with queues before the flight was called. Friendly staff on the flight with lights out after takeoff and a tray service offered. The dessert and cheese and drinks was perfect before an ok sleep. The flight is too short for a decent sleep and the club world layout is now dated and in a real need of a re-think. Once cutting edge, it's not fun being stepped over by a stranger and there is a real lack of privacy. Breakfast was ok with the hot muffin being a confused offereing. Returning from Heathrow 10 days later started with a very slow check in process - unusual for T5 with agents blaming cancellations from the previous day spilling over. Went straight to the club lounge on the B gates which is a hidden gem - quiet, well stocked, few children and in good condition. Pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to first on arrival in the lounge . A superb flight with BA first at it's best. Decent vintage champagne before take off, friendly, engaging and professional crew made the experience really first class - impressive given the cabin was full. Great Rose Champagne, an excellent wine list - especially the reds, and well cooked food. A movie, afternoon tea and we arrived head of time into Toronto. The bags almost beat us off. BA can be variable in service - especially in Club World and some of the cost cutting in recent years - though these return flights reminded me of the old BA and how good it can be at its best.",9/10

243,"""a very uncomfortable flight""","✅ Verified Review |  Vancouver to Barcelona via Heathrow with British Airways. I would like to start this review by stating that the only reviews I've taken time to write in my life were positive ones, choosing to ignore negativity. This however will sadly be my first negative review and even sadder to say that I'm taking time to write this before we've even completed our round trip with British Airways, to be more direct I'm writing this on our final connector flight to Barcelona. On February 24th, 2016 I purchased a round trip with cancellation flight from Vancouver, Canada to Barcelona, Spain. This was a surprise for fiance for her 30th birthday as well as our 1 year engagement anniversary. Naturally we counted down the days in excitement booking ourselves an apartment and scheduling reservations for dinner as well as tickets to a Barcelona FC match. Even setting up scheduling for grandparents on each side for our 9 month old daughter.  April 16th, 1 day before our trip I receive a email labeled ""updated travel itinerary."" When I opened the email, our flights no longer included our flight from Vancouver to Barcelona, actually they only had a return flight from Barcelona on April 27th. As I had got home late on April 16th from Cuba, I couldn't contact anyone until early morning of April 17th (my Fiance's birthday). Convinced it was just a mistake we thought nothing of it. Upon calling in the morning we were informed that our flight had been ""cancelled"". We tried everything we could to make any flight happen that day but were told there was only 1 seat remaining and that my fiance could fly out on the 17th and I follow on the 18th, which as an engaged couple makes no sense. We decided to look past this and try to seek reimbursement for the apartments fees and other things that we were now out of money on due to arriving a day late. This began a huge run around of my fiance trying to submit their online form 3 separate times only for the screen to read ""submitting"" for roughly 30-60 minutes each time, never one actually submitting. We decide again to overlook this and deal with it at the check in counter at YVR. The agent we were speaking to was a very nice lady who went above and beyond to figure out what happened to our flight the previous day as it left as originally scheduled without us on it. She put a note on our file that an agent from Jacksonville BA had cancelled our flights for no apparent reason. We asked for an upgrade on our seats, that wasn't available to us. We asked for access to the BA lounge while we waited, we were told that was full even though we walked past an empty lounge on the way to our flight. After a very uncomfortable flight to Heathrow we spoke to an agent there, who again was helpful in pulling up our file notes and sending a email to get the ball rolling for us on the reimbursement process (which we still have to wait for a reply before we can go ahead trying to recoup slome of our losses, which unfortunately still wouldn't get us the day we missed back). She went the extra step to grant us access to the lounge while waiting and moved our seats up a few rows. That was a breath of fresh air until we realized that we had been moved to the row right behind the curtains. While we snacked on a 1/4 of a sandwich portion of food we could hear the plated dishes on the other side of the curtains and good food people were eating all the while staring at minimum 4 empty seats. We are now trying to make jokes out of the fact of if we will ever get home.",2/10

On our flight to Larnaca the FA's had a terrific attitude , were courteous and the cabin service director was professional and polite. The older type seating is far more comfortable than the new slimline seating adopted but still only just bearable after nearly 5 hrs of sitting. The 767,s still have an air of spaciousness compared to the A320 that is used on this route.

Oxygen levels very low with many passengers complaining of headaches etc. Staff not interested yet as usual British Airways employees sneak into business class and seemed to get a reasonable service! As usual, you say never use them again on this route but very little choice as only competition is Virgin and they are not that good either.

We were told our luggage by the local luggage handlers who contacted British Airways would be on the next flight 3.5 hours later - we were given the option of waiting or have it delivered to our place of residence. We had no option but wait since the keys to our residence were in the luggage. 3.5 hours we came to claim our luggage and only 2 pieces out of 3 showed up. Again going through the local baggage handlers they now informed us that our remaining luggage would now be shipped the next morning, 14 hours later - again they gave us the option of delivering the luggage unfortunately our keys were inside. We had no choice but stay in a hotel in Lisbon and wait. I was disappointed but understand things don't go as planned sometimes. We contacted British Airways upon our return to inform them of the experience. The response was less than friendly this is why my review. They replied saying they are not responsible for any luggage. Really? When I purchase my tickets I got an email to make sure that luggage specification on luggage allowed by the airline in question. My understanding with our ticket purchase in piece of luggage no more than 23 Kgs per passenger and 1 Carry on. Where did I go wrong.",1/10
254,"""incompetent staff at check in""","I received a message at 3am to inform me that my British Airways flight from Zurich to LCY will be delayed by 1 hour. Travelling with a 5yr old, and already staying at the Zurich Airport Radisson, I decided to arrive at the check in 2 hrs before the new departure time. Unfortunately, the incompetent staff at the check in desk informed me that the flight is Closed and no more check ins. I knew this was incorrect, and asked for the Supervisor, who knew that the flight, being at least 1 hour late departure (2.5hrs as it turned out) is not closed! We were checked in of course! BA - please train your check in staff or fire the incompetent ones. Luckily, as a very frequent flyer, I was not going to accept the nonsense of the first check in who suggested we should fly in the evening?",2/10
255,British Airways customer review,Arrived slightly stressed as flight from Oslo delayed nearly 2 hours due to engine problem. Crew were caring and assured us that bags were on board. Food excellent and wine great. CSD informed us that a snow storm was on the way and we might be stuck in NYC as their flight the next night had already been cancelled. Newark was deserted and bags were there in 5 minutes. Overall superb flight with British Airways from London to Newark.,10/10
256,"""very pleasant flights""","British Airways return from Glasgow to New York via Heathrow on A321 and Boeing 747-400. The domestic flights are nice enough, good legroom and comfortable seat, drink and packet of crisps or biscuit provided. LHR to JFK both ways on the 747-400, the crew friendly, and the seats are comfy for the 7 hour flight - they maybe difficult on a longer flight but for this perfect. In flight entertainment is very good. Very pleasant flights and would recommend.",10/10

All in all a very good experience.",8/10
258,"""abyssal customer service""","London to New York JFK with British Airways, and abyssal customer service. Onboard the flight can be great, and it's the website and shoddy call centre staff who let them down. However, this time the onboard service was as bad as the ground service. Food was poor. I was in the upper deck with only 5 other business class passengers, and yet my food choice was gone. The TV's didn't work in 2 seats - I couldn't be bothered to try a third and decided to just get some sleep. The staff insisted on forming a cliquish huddle and were speaking so loudly I couldn't even sleep with ear plugs in.",3/10
259,"""service was terrible""","Johannesburg to Dublin via London after Christmas. Was excited as on British Airways A380. What a disappointing flight. The service was terrible, very young and inexperienced cabin crew. Had to wait ages for them to answer my bell when I rang it. Food was awful, my partner didn't get a bread roll or milk with dinner. Seats are bigger in this plane but still uncomfortable. The worst of all is the luggage allowance. 23kg! Other airlines allow 30kg in Economy. What a performance from the airline when we were 3kg over. Also having to pay for seats if you want to book them is disgusting. I will never use British Airways again.",2/10
260,"""only book BA if lowest fare""","British Airways from Vienna to Newcastle via Heathrow return, flights on-time. Economy on an A320. FA’s much better on domestic legs, while both times on VIE legs the FA’s were professional, but nothing more and not doing more than absolutely required. Information from the flight deck was friendly and excellent. A snack and drinks were served - snack a highly processed sandwich (barely edible) on the VIE flights and crisps/biscuits on the NCL flights. Additional drinks on request. A320 featured the new slim seats and I miss the older more comfortable BA seats with better leg room. BA has recently changed the rules and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. Selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs EUR 18). If one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping EUR 75 at the airport or EUR 35 online. Being Oneworld Sapphire does not help either. No privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checked luggage. So, BA became a low cost model, except for drinks service. However the prices do not reflect this change in service. On the last leg LHR-VIE carry-on luggage was heavily policed. Although my carry-on luggage met the weight requirements and fits in the overhead bin and has so without any problems on the previous three legs and twenty previous BA flights, I was required to check it in. It was also not a question of occupied space, as it happened in the priority line. Hopefully just a power trip by the gate agent. However, here goes the main advantage of BA, which was a carry-on policy that enabled passengers to realistically travel without the hassle of checking bags. Boarding by the same agent was again bizarre. Instead of priority boarding, there were now four different types of priority boarding, and the procedure left everybody confused and everybody just stood there blocking the access to the gate, so that finally it became a cattle call with everyone boarding at the same time. Another thing is, that recent changes in BA’s frequent flyer program make it impossible to reach a meaningful status even for regular flyer unless you regularly fly Club on long distance routes. Obviously, BA is trying very hard to annoy its frequent travelers. While I stopped flying Business with BA probably a year ago after they downgraded their Club Europe cabin and I was avoiding their long distance flights for a long time due to their terrible seating arrangement, I believe BA’s European economy was a great product and I was using BA regularly for those flights. However, after all these recent changes, I will only book BA if they offer the lowest or close to the lowest fare. For flights to the UK, KLM starts to look pretty good again.",5/10
261,"""tired and jaded aircraft""","British Airways from London Heathrow to Mumbai from Terminal 5 in coach class. Check in uneventful. No boarding priority for people travelling with children, a first for me for any long haul flight. Five minutes before departure, captain announces that someone has checked in a bag but has not turned up so they need to take off the offending suitcase. Fair enough. The staff had botched up loading the suitcase by marking it to be in a container in which it wasn't. Result they started taking off all the containers one by one and searching for the flight. Captain told that he cannot give any estimate. 90 minutes passed after that no announcement, a tired and jaded cabin crew literally disappeared. After 90 mins they realised that people might be hungry and started serving juice. Finally after 1 hr 45 mins captain said that they had found the rogue suitcase and we will be off in 15 mins. The plane suddenly started a push back without any warning. The aircraft was a jaded B747-400, poor seats, poor entertainment equipment which had to be rebooted thrice before it worked. Once airborne the crew said that people were hungry so there will not be a drink service they will be serving lunch - possibly an excuse to do less work. Lunch was ok. Second flight service was a snack before landing for which they lost the child meal I had requested, and shamefully tried to create one by adding a fruit shot to an adult meal. Overall poor airline, with tired and jaded aircraft and an equally tired and jaded looking staff.",1/10
262,"""service very good and friendly""","Third time flying the British Airways A380 and the only reason that we did is because it was a BA Amex 2for1 redemption. However to ensure that we maxed out the experience, as always we pre booked seats. On checking in online seats had been moved, contacted BA Bronze and reply was ""cannot answer why, possibly operational reasons, more information should be available at check in"". Check in, no response. On board our seats were occupied by what appeared to be ""normal"" passengers, i.e. no entourage. Seats we were allocated, lumbar and head rest functions did not operate, cabin crew tried rebooting but no luck, so onwards and upwards. Having flown BA a reasonable amount I have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew, despite operating with poorly designed cabins, poorly maintained (seats) equipment (we had a similar scenario on a Heathrow to LA and return last July where we had the same reg plane, same seats and similar problem which was not fixed after the flight out) manage to maintain a brave company face. BA Club Lounge: Again, food choice poor, running out, although granted peak hours, but if other airlines can cope why cannot BA? Cabin crew: Service very good and friendly. Food reasonable, but nothing that makes you say that ""that was good"". Entertainment: Poor, old ""ish"" and second rate movies, enough said. Seats: Unfortunately in this case we leave the worst till last. Having flown Qantas, Emirates and Qatar A380's like everybody else we wonder why BA did not take the opportunity for a redesign of layout and seat area. Well we know why = £££'s, Question? Does no one on the BA cabin design team wear glasses? There is no storage space, if it goes in the drawer with the shoes, you have to move the seat from sleep position to access, so you are left with the possibility of either wearing and damaging said specs, or hanging them over the separator. Again, competitors manage it. The seat itself, is harder than the competitors above (mattress?) and apparently I discovered that extra pillows are no longer carried, so you have one and thats it. Unfortunately, we do still have to use BA next March, but have booked Qatar again for October. Additionally, the Customer Service service in India is sadly woefully short in all areas, although polite working from scripts and unable to solve / answer simple questions. Frustration. A question for BA: We really want to support and be proud of our national flag carrier but what are the incentives for using BA? I do not mean cost.",5/10
263,"""enough legroom for a tall man""",Flew British Airways from GIG to LHR. Nice easy check in with no extra charge for an overweight case. Got 4 seats together even though we couldn't check in online. Enough legroom for a tall man. Staff were all great and very friendly and helpful. 2 meals which were pretty good for an airplane and drinks on request. I emailed a request to let my father in law see the cockpit after landing and they pulled out all the stops for him. Made his holiday. Our Wheelchair was waiting at the aircraft door when we got off. Couldnt fault them.,10/10
264,"""BA really did not care""","I have flown British Airways Business Class and was pleased with Lounge, food service, Elemis Spa, showers wit Elemis products and on request champagne. Onboard with comfortable fully reclining seats, duvet and amenities appropriately dispersed per sex. Staff friendly and accommodating, cabin (upper deck- A380) clean and comfortable. My next trip in August was last minute with just First available. I felt very comfortable booking this since my experience in business has always been very nice. My past experiences with First prior to renovated cabins, separate seating cells- I felt it was still going to be a lovely, comfortable experience, with enjoyable food. So, with all the changes in First now, I thought I would really be in for a relaxing treat. I want to preface this by saying I have always loved British Airways and has always been my first choice for London- Houston, JFK-London flights for years. I had a early flight. Checked in in ample time before my flight. I went straight to the Concorde Room to have breakfast. What I was met with was basically a cafeteria style, self serve service. There was no table service, two people working behind the food counter. I met an English couple while waiting in-line to put in a simple scramble eggs on toast order as they and we were both told that the toaster was in front of us, and we needed to toast on own bread. It all went downhill from there. The wait was long, traveling on your own you had to keep an eye on your table to make sure it was not taken, tables were left unserviced and unclean. I carried some dishes to the front just so I could be seated. Boarded plane, seated, and started looking around and the carpet was dirty. It looked as it had not been vacuumed from the last flight, which did not give me a clean and comfortable feeling. The the steward came to me and said they ran out of women's toiletry kits because they do not allot according to reservation, but normally catering to men traveling on business and not women traveling on pleasure. He offered a Men's toiletry kit and a Business Class kit. The food was served. I started with their appetizers which was all dry and very unappetizing (and I am not picky), but for me to find it unappealing it has to be poor. Then the entrees were short and I had to choose a second choice. Any one of these events would be okay- even though they advertised that all is superb, but everything, constantly occurring had me regretting I paid for First and have sworn, for the price differential vs service and quality,  Business Class wins out hands down. The food was far from septacular or tasty - it felt overcooked and choices limited and short. The Pilot did come out and asked if BA could call me and he was very apologetic (I guess a Steward/ess mentioned the faux pas's  - I consented. Disappointment ran consistent from beginning to end - no call, no email, no apology - in my opinion that is the epitome of service from beginning to end. It left me feeling that BA really did not care about any of it - the service in lounges, the appropriate allocation of food, kits, cleanliness- all of it. My flight back to JFK I flew Business. It was comfortable. Though there was less space in First class seats years ago, but the service was brilliant and comfortable and the food was delicious. I am sad my experience this time could not compare to years gone by - even if it was more simplistic. My review is for First only.",3/10
265,"""crummy Boeing 747s""","London Heathrow to Miami on one of British Airways crummy Boeing 747s. Originally Booked WT Plus choosing flight in an A380 with shiny new updated cabin and entertainment system for 3rd year in a row, and for the 3rd year in a row they promptly changed the plane on my flight for a very elderly and not updated Boeing 747. Do BA actually have any A380's? Reasonably comfortable, but the old on demand entertainment system had a poor choice of films and programs. Cabin staff and food okay from memory but, as usual with British Airways nowadays, very small portions. Took off slightly late in fog, made up time on flight and landed slightly early at Miami. Old aircraft notwithstanding I still think WT Plus is well worth the extra - 7 inches of extra legroom is so much more comfortable than coach.",6/10

We never received ""paid for seats"" that we have just had £160.00 refunded back on to my credit card after complaining that we never on both legs of our flights. We had been told that we would not get refund as we had assistance? I e-mail them and informed I had my e-mail confirmation of set numbers and payment and seat ticket subs to prove my claim and at no point did I ask for or need or receive any assistance. They back tracked and I was informed my claim was authorised and it would take 6/8 weeks. British Airways need to stop this practice as it does not show the Airline in a good light. I would be wary of using British Airways long haul again, the aircraft are too old and shabby, and the female stewardess need to go back on a training course on customer service. Spirit of service what happened to that.",4/10
267,"""is well worth the extra""","Outward leg in Premium Economy on British Airways A380. Seats very comfortable, great leg room and much larger entertainment screen. Food acceptable, has improved since last trip. However, Premium Economy section is now so big you lose any exclusive experience that you used to enjoy on older aircraft. Also, what do you have to do to get a window seat.? Even as a Ruby member able to select a seat 7 days in advance I have just found it to be impossible. Who or what do those guys sitting in the window seats know? Return leg on the Boeing 747-400, old but in good condition and very clean. Still no window seat but I do feel that Premium Economy is well worth the extra coin.",8/10
268,"""return trip not worth it""","Checked in and found the Club lounge was ""landside"" meaning one had to allow time to get through security after using it. I need not have worried as I spent all of 60 seconds in the shared lounge that British Airways use with about eight airlines. As BA have 3 daily flights to Hannover and potentially 60+ users of the facility, I could have been forgiven to thinking there might be some decent food around. Wrong! The meal was a bunch of dried up sausages in a steamer that looked like samples in a medical lab. Ghastly. A few bits of cheese here and there and that was it. I quickly moved on and had an excellent dinner in the Movenpick restaurant a few meters away.  Only three passenger in Club and the plane pushed back 5 minutes early. The meal I was offered was a reasonable looking prawn salad. I declined as I was well fed. A couple of Gin and Tonics and the flight of 90 minutes passed easily. FAs very friendly. Landing was in high winds and very well executed. Was the return trip worth it for £800? Not really but then my client paid the bill.",3/10
269,"""First class was underwhelming""","Cape Town to London Heathrow. The new British Airways lounge at Cape Town is a big improvement on the lounge that used to be shared with Virgin, however it filled up quickly with passengers for the two flights. Our new First class seats (2A/3A) were already showing their age, so the plane was probably one of the first to be retrofitted. Unfortunately, the crew in First were young and disinterested. Neither of us were addressed by our names at any point during the flight. The dinner service was slow and the food mediocre (cold and dry or overcooked and dry). Ironically, they ran out of the South African white wine. The entertainment system wasn't working for most of the flight. British Airways should provide an iPad alternative in First when that happens. PJs and the flat bed made up with a duvet are good touches, but the flight was too turbulent for uninterrupted sleep. The Boeing 747-400 toilets are ridiculously small for changing in and out of clothes. Overall, the experience was underwhelming.",5/10
270,"""Business seats are horrid""","Roundtrip with British Airways from Bangkok to London in Club World. Really the only good thing to talk about is the baggage allowance. The seats are horrid. Cramped and you feel like you're in a coffin if you have the backward-facing window seats. It's unbelievably cramped and when I pay more than 4x the economy ticket, I expect a place to keep a water bottle when the seat is in bed-mode. The main meal outbound was not heated and had to be returned.  The pre-ordered beef on the inbound was dry. Changed it for the cold King prawn salad with couscous only to be told it was actually chicken. The bathrooms are hideous and there's no distinction between economy and business. Blocked washbasin, tissue fibres all over the place, stained walls and peeling finishes. Crew outbound were older and very pleasant. Inbound was a much younger crew and only one (Spanish lady) was truly aware of passenger needs. The rest were more intent on getting to Bangkok to party than to serve passengers with a smile. Boarding at LHR they were all in the galley blocking access to the other side of the cabin, chattering to each other and not one welcome or eye-contact after entering the door. The Club Word lounge meal offerings at T5 were abysmal. More like a school canteen. If anyone from BA reads these opinions, then please do something about your dreadful IFE. It's archaic and that's being polite. Fuzzy, small screens and if you choose a movie with subtitles, they're illegible.",3/10
271,"""way British Airways handled this was atrocious""","I was among the several hundred passengers whose British Airways flight was canceled last night from Dallas Ft Worth to London. No status indicating canceled was put on the displays at the gate, once the decision was made. They were not updated. People were told to call 1-800-AIRWAYS for help, but were turned away by the phone system, and as a result lost their places in line. One woman had a glimmer of hope with the phone system, only to be told that because she was traveling with a baby, she had to go back and wait in line. Only 4 ticket counters were open to assist the passengers, and each passenger took over 20-30 minutes to help, on average. One couple took approximately 2 hours to be helped because they were booked to go on a cruise for their anniversary and this delay cost them their connection. They were not able to get any arrangements that would get them to their cruise for another 3 days. The couple will now miss half their cruise. No screening was performed to get people with important connecting flights (like that couple or myself) close to the front of the line. There were two other flights out to LHR that night that would have allowed me to still make my tour, but due to the disorganization of the help, I missed both, even though one was 5.5 hours after the original cancellation. It did not help that the British Airways staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line, for no reason. I was still in time to make the last flight out at 10:10pm, but a couple was allowed to cut in front of me in line and as a result by the time my new bookings were made it was too late. People were falling out of line because there was no area to rest, or provisions made for food or going to the restroom. The customers were too exhausted to stand for that long. No attempt to ""take a number"" and call people back was made for the comfort of customers. Not even water was passed out during the 6 hour waiting period. The counter staff, and how they were managed, was completely inadequate. The way British Airways handled this cancellation was atrocious! Things break, including airplanes, which is understood, but the manner in which a company recovers from such debacles says a great deal about their character. I am sorely disappointed in how this was dealt with. I will now miss the first, and arguably most anticipated, part of my tour to India, and my traveling companion (coming from Atlanta) will be there alone, which is not safe for a young, single female. This airline has cost me time, money, and most importantly safety, for myself and my friend.",1/10

However, the quality of the seatback screens and the seats are very tired, and very oudated. The films and tv shows are good, however the quality of the screen is poor, compared to other airlines. The seats are also well past their serviceable life. Other airlines offer far better seats and entertainment so it is rather disappointing British Airways don't. Even other, newer, BA planes have far superior seats and VOD, to which it is shocking the difference in the service offered for economy class, there isn't even a charging port in the Boeing 747 when there is on the newer planes. At least the meals were good.",6/10

274,"""keep expectations in check""","The 747 is definitely showing it's age. Nonetheless it was comfortable. Pre take off drinks offered included water, OJ or sparkling wine. BA also gives the option of pre-ordering your choice of main course online so although I did notice they ran out of choice towards the end of the service I had received my beef. I advise anyone in First/Business/World Traveller Plus to use this facility. World traveller Plus is definitely an 'enhanced economy' versus some airlines premium economy which is more a 'business minus'. So keep expectations in check. You get a bigger seat, pre take off drink, little amenity kit and a slightly upgraded meal. However, considering that I paid only £170 per sector on top of the usual World Traveller (economy) fare it was worth every penny in my eye. Would I pay a crazy supplement for this class of travel? No. But if the surcharge is minimal I'd highly recommend it.",7/10

Suggest persons allocating the choices research better into preferences, as we struggled to get first choice on all sectors (seated in last row of Premium Economy.  Criticisms would be that British Airways charge extra for you to select seats prior to ensure you are sitting next to your companion and there is no priority check-in or boarding/luggage. Toilets are in economy cabin and could be lengthy waits, whilst other airlines provide dedicated toilets for Premium Economy. However, the fare for SYD-LHR return pretty good value.",8/10

Meal vouchers were give at 20.00 for those who were still at the gate. Then after 21.00 an announcement to get luggage and hotel vouchers from the arrival hall. Next information will be given next morning at 09.00, which later was postponed until 14.30. Requests of rebookings were refused as the flight were not cancelled. They just said come to the airport early enough. British Airways failed to provide information about EU passanger's rights as it had to be requested separately. Lot of fellow passsengers were not aware of their rights. Next afternoon local grond handling company only had regular number of check-in desks open even there were two flights cheking-in at the same time. So only three desks open and they were not able to start checking us in but requesting us to step aside for the same day flight passengers. Great as we had only been waiting around 22hrs for our flights. Finally our flight got new departure time which was at 17.30, later to changed 18.00. At the gate departure time came and went and no announcement were made. Departure time were postponed until 18.30 with no announcement of reason for new delay. When requesting some futher information it was said it's the same reason as yesterday but we had been given a written statement saying this aircraft had been fixed. At 18.30 still no announcement and passengers get anxious about mimimal information given by aviator. Then 20 min later British Airways cancels this flight. Now rebookings promised by next morning or then have to contact British Airways directly. Another hotel night at the airport hotel and we already knew how the procedure goes. Next day rebooked for Finnair flight to London and arriving London 45 hrs late and reaching the final destination about 46hrs late.

This is my 3rd time I have flown this route onboard one of the Boeing 747-400 and I must say British Airways have got to either fully upgrade their B747 fleet or retire the aircraft. The seats are far too cramped and not comfortable, the in flight entertainment had to be rebooted several times as they stopped working or didn't work at all, the heat in the cabin was unbearable at times and very uncomfortable. The only plus points were crew who were very attentiveand willing to help and the food wasn't too bad. I am aware that around 18 Boeing 747's are getting refitted but by the look of it unfortunately the B747 on the Phoenix route is not, and for me as the route I travel, causes me concern and has me wondering if I will travel with BA again.  Not everyone can afford to fly business or first but that doesn't mean that we give up on the right to have a little space to move, seats that don't feel like they are going to cripple you, have an entertainment system that works and has a better selection of movies/tv shows/music. Other airlines such as Emirates have a fabulous system even in economy so why can't British Airways use the same type of technology. If BA want to compete, please do something about it.",3/10

I did look at the business class seats which are basically the same as economy, so will probably not fly business with BA shorthaul again, but will stay with economy.

The legroom was as expected and I had no complaints about that, but the food was awful and the service was terrible. We were sat next to a group of drunken passengers who were loud and were continued to be served drinks throughout. I am sure this didn't make the cabin crew job easy but they seemed quite disorganised - running out of drinks etc. As we were sitting in the back of the plane there seemed to be no choices by the time we were offered food - the crew were not really interested. When asked about an alternative they forgot to come back to us and when asked again they offered exactly what we refused. The food was poor quality, dry hard chicken with very little flavour. Breakfast was an egg mayonnaise roll and again there was no alternative.

You can see the individuals are trying, but it seems the business just doesn't want them to be able to deliver that world class First service they owned for all those years. I can only assume it's about cost cutting as their planes are so dated and falling to bits now. Especially when you compare it other airlines like Cathay or American Airlines. In all honesty, if you can fly an alternate airline, you'll probably get a better first class cabin and cheaper - I'd recommend it. Also, how does this airline not have Wifi on their long haul yet? Once a pioneer of the air world. British Airways is now a half dead dinosaur with no real sense of direction.",3/10
284,"will never fly British Airways again ""","I have flown business class long haul on Emirates, Qatar Airways, Air France, KLM, American, Singapore, Thai Airways, Cathay Pacific and most recently British Airways for work within the last 24 months. I fly long haul 8-10 times a year so I would consider myself to be a moderate user of the service and know what I should expect for the money. I will never fly British Airways again if I can avoid it. I arrived on time and it felt like a safe journey, but everything from check in, to the seat configuration and comfort (and cleanliness), the food and the entertainment system were so far away from the competition. The cabin crew were snooty on the A380 out of LHR - in this example I was a silent observer to several unacceptable customer service responses. The only redeeming feature of the whole experience was the staff at the Washington Dulles lounge, the rest of BA could learn a lot in there. Very disappointing BA, its a shame your product quality is so below par. I'm proud to be British, but not when it comes to our national carrier, what a shame.",2/10
285,"""customer service gone out of the window""","Upgraded to Club Europe on outward journey for a treat. Check in queue at ""dedicated Club Europe"" desk was dreadful. Staff like bouncers with no customer service skills. Heard one say to a young man ""you should have got up earlier"". Only when we got restless did they open the fence to let us go to an idle check in operator. Then the ""priority"" security process was nonsense, just as slow as elsewhere. Staff on board excellent. On return journey I checked in online as usual. Changed our seats to the final row. Got on board to find the row had no window. Flight too full to move elsewhere. Partner a very nervous flyer and had a horrible journey back, felt he was in a coffin, and heart flutter returned next day due to stress of the journey. All made worse by 30 min delay on departure and a further 30 min delay before being allowed to land at LHR. Next day I contacted British Airways customer services online to ask why there was no indication at all on the aircraft seat plan that row 25 on A319 had no window. No response at all apart from automated ""we're busy but will get back to you asap"". A week later I sent the same response, with original complaint number, again online. No response at all, not even the automated one. I'm left feeling that British Airways is now Ryanair, though even they have been trying to improve their service and image recently. The days of British Airways as a classic British airline, with good service and professionalism went with the sale of it to other nations. It is not what it appears. We also noted that cabin staff in economy could barely cope with a full cabin. Instead of a trolley starting at either end, there was only one with two staff. For the ""widest short range jet"" of 25 rows, 6 across this was not enough. Costs have been cut, clearly staff are demoralised and customer service has gone out of the window. Obviously, not the window at row 25.",2/10
286,"""space in economy is abysmal""","Las Vegas to London Heathrow with British Airways. What we were expecting and what we got are two separate things.  We boarded the aircraft on time, and were greeted at the doorway, but once inside, the cabin crew were more interested in themselves and chatting - no help anywhere! We settled into our seats, which were narrow and very cramped, and the heat in the cabin was very uncomfortable to the point that the majority of the passengers were fanning themselves down with safety cards. The service commenced once the flight was underway and free drinks were offered, and if you fancied a beer the only choice was lager or lite lager. The meal commenced shortly after and my wife had ordered a lactose free meal which she was given - or so she thought until she looked closely and everything contained dairy products. This was changed when it was brought to the attention the of the crew, and looking back I think she would have been better with the wrong choice that was given, and suffered the consequences as it looked unappetising, bland and who knows what it was. No vegetables, no meat. The rest of the meals were served (or should I say thrown at us) offering pasta or chicken. The attitude from the cabin crew was very poor and some were rude and arrogant. For the majority of the flight the cabin crew were invisible. One  of the screens in the seatback wasn't working so this was rectified 30 minutes after the cabin crew being told - why aren't these things checked prior to boarding? The space you get in economy is abysmal, the person in front of me put his seat back and was nearly lying on me, the leg room is shocking and the seats uncomfortable. My son couldn't eat his meal until the person in front put the seat up as he couldn't see it. The cabin crew should make an announcement when meals are served for passengers to upright the seats out of courtesy to the people behind or tell people when they're serving meals - no they don't, as it would be too much of an effort for them. The only good thing about the flight was arriving early so we could get off it. Would we fly British Airways again - on this experience no, you would have more room in a tin of sardines! British Airways need to get their finger out and start offering a quality service to everybody on the flight - not just the passengers in the posh seats, and maybe send some of the staff on a customer care course.",2/10
287,"""service ok""","LHR-ARN-LHR with British Airways, return 29th and 31st August. Check in online quick as was bag drop at T5, used galleries Sth lounge which I've always liked. Breakfast on offer at 7am. Boarding quick however the use of a bus to a remote stand always feels odd at an airlines hub newish aircraft with new Club Europe seating first time using this layout and must say felt not much different to economy. Flight away on time, service ok with english breakfast on offer. Crew ok. Landed a little early. Return check in quick and easy although 3rd party lounge is just ok, flight departed on time lasting 2hr 35min, crew pretty nice and the old CE layout on this A320 appeared comfier, afternoon tea served which was ok. Flight arrived a little late but on to a stand so no bus trip. I'm unsure if Club in Europe is still worth the extra, I have a few more BA European flights coming up so will judge once I've used economy and club once more.",7/10
288,British Airways customer review,"I didn't really know what to expect from this flight, it had been a couple of years since my last BA flight (Gatwick to Nice in that case) we were on our way to Lyon Airport from the city centre and noticed the flight had only just departed London. Upon arrival at the airport we found it to be delayed by 40 minutes. With little information given as to why. When we finally got round to boarding there was no organisation, a bit like every man for himself. What amused me was that the captain came on over the PA and encouraged passengers to hurry and take their seats as we had only 9 minutes to keep our slot. Safe to say because of the lack of organisation we missed our slot and we sat on the aircraft for another 50 minutes while we awaited a new slot. The captain kept us informed as best he could, the cabin crew showed no effort at all. They showed no will to actually be there, they didn't check on passengers bearing in mind it was 39°C outside and this was affecting the temperature inside the aircraft. Once we took off the service seemed rushed, I wasn't able to get any food at the airport so was hoping for something that would keep me full on the journey back, no so much a pitiful Ham and Cheese bun thing and a drink. There was no personal touch to it. As we were approaching Heathrow all we could hear from the rear galley (we were in the back row) was the two crew complaining about their hours. I'm flying with BA Citiflyer to Dublin in September, if the service hasn't improved I'll think twice if I really need to travel BA again.",3/10
289,British Airways customer review,"Slight delay. Games advertised on website, not able to access in economy. TV not working for 1st hour, then when it did, couldn't hear it though the provided headphones, so had to choose film with subtitles. Although staff doing their jobs, the 3 near us seemed to have an attitude, a man behind asked for a cup of tea and the flight assistant muttered under his breath. My partially sighted mother asked politely for milk with her tea and the flight assistant, made her feel stupid by shoving it in her face and sarcastically saying ""there it is"". I realise she didn't know my mother was partially sighted, but maybe she should be aware that you can't always see people's disabilities. I had no problem with our outbound flight to Denver from Heathrow, (except the headphones) the staff on that plane were all very pleasant, I will think twice before booking BA again.",1/10
290,British Airways customer review,"Easy check in at T5 and good passport/security/gate transit. Flight boarded 20/25 mins late due to issues with airbridge.

Food 8/10 for both dinner and breakfast. Flight made up some time so nearly on schedule. Bags first of carousel, so all in all a good travel experience.",8/10

292,British Airways customer review,"Where shall I start, 4 hours delay or the days without my luggage? I came to Nassau for my wedding, me, my wife and our 3 best friends. We arrived to Nassau on Tuesday with 4 hours delay, but the most annoying part just begun. Our wedding was on Friday, me and my wife were without luggage until Thursday, due to hell knows what was going on in BA, my best mate, didn't receive his luggage for a week, and on my wedding he was best man, so I had to give him cloths to wear. We had to change the organized wedding date, to another, 3 days later. He received his luggage on a last day of his staying in Nassau. From the first day arrival, BA was contacting us and saying same thing, the luggage is coming next day, and that was for me 3 days, my friend 1 week. When I received my bag, they lost my key, that I gave in airport in Nassau to BA person, I signed the contract that I agree when my luggage arrive they can open it and check it. They lost my key and I had to cut my bag to eventually get my cloths. The plane was old, but pretty well maintained. Me and my wife slept half flight, but when we woke up, the cabin crew told us that we can't have warm food anymore - we had 3 hours to fly, and  we were hungry. BA, you almost ruined my wedding, you ruined all my friends staying, he received his bag on a last day vacation. All BA flight to Nassau that week were all delayed, from 2 to 6 hours. Never, ever again.",1/10
293,British Airways customer review,"GLA-LGW fine for a domestic flight, small snack and drink, crew pleasant enough, but arrival process at Gatwick was irritating. My next flight from LHR so after a rather fraught journey across London I checked in at Terminal 5 and had to wait while check in assistant called several numbers trying to get a ""Visa Check"" performed by a member of staff who came to the desk to check my documentation. The flight to Moscow began with a long bus journey (longer than the one already endured at Gatwick) around Heathrow tarmac to the waiting aircraft. The flight was due to leave at 21:50 and although the seat was comfortable, the aircraft was extremely hot and stuffy for the duration of the flight. The crew appeared impatient with passengers and quickly served a small sandwich and drink. Another drinks run would have been appreciated as the heat in the cabin was almost nauseating. Arrival in Domodedovo airport at 03:40 local time. Not BA's best effort but nothing seriously wrong.",7/10
294,British Airways customer review,"I am a regular user of BA and generally find the airline to be OK but not outstanding. This flight was fairly full , departed on time and check in was very quick. In my opinion the 747 fleet of BA needs either replacement of extensive refurbishment, these aircraft are all old and look it in the interior. The seats were past their prime and quite uncomfortable. The food offering was very poor, no fresh items either at dinner or for breakfast. Staff were OK, punctuality was good and baggage delivery although not fast was acceptable. Inflight entertainment was good but the TV screens are from a previous age with quite poor quality",6/10
295,British Airways customer review,"Short trip to Vienna in BA Economy Class from Terminal 3. New A320 cabin on the flight out - looks nice and fairly comfortable for a couple of hours. Other than the cheap, highly processed cheese and ham croissant and a coffee you are given it is no different to a low cost airline. Staff service minimal - they served breakfast and collected the leftovers, basically in the cabin twice during the entire 2 hour and 10 minute flight - not even an additional beverage service. I'm sure if they were flogging the drinks it would be different. Return a couple of days later, older aircraft but clean. Same indifferent service, similar processed carbs handed out in silence and 1 drink. This wasn't a cheap ticket (over 200GBP) - I know BA are competing with low cost airlines in Europe but when are they going to realise they aren't a low cost airline? A bit of chat from the staff and a couple of extra coffees would have made all difference to how I felt leaving those flights. BA sadly seem to be falling behind the crowd.",4/10
296,British Airways customer review,"Flew Club Europe to Istanul on 767, boarding was speedy and boarding completed quickly for an on time departure. The flight was excellent and the crew in Club Europe were as always providing excellent service and professional at all times. Although the 767 is showing its age, I still prefer this aircraft to the A320's which also are used on this route, on the 767 at least the Club Europe seats are comfortable and offer plenty of leg room unlike the new Club Europe which is used on the A320's which is in reality going back to the days of charter airlines! So come on British Airways lets go back to the old configurations where we have plenty of leg room in Club Europe and reduce the rows of seats, we do not want Low Cost Airline look alikes otherwise we would fly them, we choose BA because we are loyal to you so bring back your old standards once again.",9/10
297,British Airways customer review,"LHR to KUL. Bag drop off took much longer than expected especially as we had already checked and printed our boarding passes. Full plane left about 45 mins late. Food and drink better than expected, as was cabin crew service and seat comfort. Friendly and efficient service. I suspect the plane might have seen better days given that the entertainment system was ancient - no games, small screen compared with the likes of Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. Some cost cutting evident - no menus, hot towels, metal cutlery - which is fine by me.  Would be happy to fly with them again.",7/10
298,British Airways customer review,"Flew First Class 2A from Chicago to London, easy boarding and excellent service provided at all times by the cabin crew in First Class. The food was excellent and a good selection available too. Breakfast was good with a nice selection with plenty of organge juice and tea which came in a pot which was a lovely touch. If you are flying British Airways and connecting from an American Airlines domestic flight do note that you can now transfer from T3 to T5 at Chicago airside by shuttle bus which runs every 30 mins thus avoiding the security lines in T5, this applies only to BA Passengers tranferring from an American Airlines or American Eagle flight to a British Airways flight.",10/10
299,British Airways customer review,"Overall the journey was good. The breakfast was okay, we were served sandwiches which weren't that appetizing.

301,British Airways customer review,"On this occasion my partner and I experienced a 3.5 hour delay with BA. There was no communication at the airport, nothing until we got onto the plane where the captain told us delays were due to a bag that had not been checked in correctly at Heathrow. Because of the delay when the plane finally arrived it had no water on board and was not permitted to fill up at our destination. This meant disgusting toilets because of no flush and no warm drinks on board. We were sat on the runway for an hour because the engines would not start. We had no aircon for 40 mins. When we finally got back to Heathrow the captain told us that he was sorry for the issues.",1/10
302,British Airways customer review,"Once boarded there was a technical fault with air conditioning and the cabin got very hot. The cabin crew did offer cold water to keep all passengers cool, and delay was only around 20 minutes. Once airborne, drinks and snacks were served. Seating on A319 was comfortable for a short flight. At GLA Airport the parking stands  are so far away from the main terminal and pick up points, and changes to the airport in the past couple of years have increased the walking distance. This is annoying if you only have hand luggage and want a quick getaway, especially on a late night arrival. One sees Easyjet and Ryanair passengers passing through the arrivals process much quicker.",8/10
303,British Airways customer review,"Very good flight in Club World from start to finish. OK, so the plane may be rather old, but it was in immaculate condition and the cabin crew (older, mostly British) delivered efficient professional and friendly service. The lie flat bed (I took a rear facing window seat) is excellent for sleeping and gives great privacy. The food offering was not amazing (some cost cutting here) and I was surprised to see nuts served in bags not on dishes. There was however a good selection of drinks and glasses were topped up as required. Inflight entertainment was excellent, with a great range of both movies and TV shows. I fly often with the middle eastern carriers who offer newer planes and a more luxury feel, however BA scored highly on crew, seat comfort and ease of sleeping. I also visited the Heathrow T3 arrivals lounge which is first class. I will definitely fly BA club world again if the price is competitive.",9/10

Food also was pretty good for economy.  747 is really showing her age now, though the cabin was clean, tidy and in good condition, it was old in style and very noisy.

305,British Airways customer review,"This review refers to a return trip from India BOM-LHR in Premium Economy. The seating is fine in this class and is definitely worth the extra from standard economy in terms of the leg room. However that's where it ends. The service compared with Business which I travelled out in, is woeful. The BA cabin staff seem to treat anybody not flying in Business or First as second-class citizens and barely do their job.

307,British Airways customer review,ZRH-LHR. A bit of a disaster. My flight BA 719 was delayed 90 minutes - and so was the preceding flight. So one is acceptable - two is well a co-incidence. (or not). Left 90 minutes late (about 20 minutes) after the earlier late departure got stacked over Kent - landing about 2 hours late - from a 80 minutes flight. Plane was almost brand new. Crew was great - but in the end couldn't care less. BA at its worst. Pathetic.,1/10
308,British Airways customer review,LGW-HER. A320 on one of BA's new tourist-orientated routes. Sadly this felt more like a charter flight with screaming kids in the row behind an appalling hot breakfast and the penny-pinching 'new' Club Europe seats which are identical in width and pitch to economy. If this is the way BA are going it doesn't make sense to pay the extra. They really should think again about their premium service.,3/10

310,British Airways customer review,Our flight on economy long distance from the Austin to Heathrow was the most uncomfortable we've had on any carrier and we have travelled extensively. The seats were so close together with hardly any leg room or arm movement that not only was it difficult to eat the food which was dreadful but very difficult to get in and out of without damaging or twisting a knee or back. We had extreme exhaustion on landing from discomfort and lack of sleep. The evening meal we were served was inedible. The pasta had been hanging around for some time by the appearance. It was dry and congealing in what was once tomato sauce. The foil container was bent and the foil cover crumpled which proves it had been handled and heated up frequently. As for the breakfast in a box it was so bad I cannot comment. We've had better food and seating on low budget airlines and as well as on Myanmar Airlines! We want to support our national airline but definitely not on BA economy. It seems all the attention and care is given to first and business class. A huge disappointment.,1/10
311,British Airways customer review,CPT-LHR-MAD in club. Check-in in CPT quick and efficient. Lounge elegant with good choice of snacks and food and an excellent selection of South African wines. Boarding was announced in the lounge. Boarding a bit chaotic. Seated in the first class section of this old 747. Greeted by name and offered a glass of champagne by a charming member of staff. Departure and arrival on time. Food and beverages of high quality and standard. As I was traveling with my husband the table was set so that we could dine together by using the companion's ottoman. Entertainment ok-the very small screen of the old first class. The bed was made by the staff using an extra mattress. A good nights sleep in a comfortable bed. Cabin crew excellent always smiling and professional. LHR-MAD in a refurbished 321. Emergency exit seat with lots of space and comfort.

314,British Airways customer review,BA1326 Heathrow to Newcastle 22/4/15. Checked in at T5 by an agent who should train some of the others. Very welcoming instantly struck up a conversation with me this person was a credit to the company and a much needed one. The good experience ended there. Punctuality reared it's ugly head once more. I've recorded this repeatedly. Departure was delayed 45 minutes. Not the end of the world but an inconvenience which happens so regularly I can pretty much count on it. It's a shame BA can't address these issues and get flights operating to schedule the majority of the time as other airlines are well able to. Once on board BA is like a tale of two airlines. Some crews are excellent others just lack professionalism and behave rather strangely at times. Possibly this may stem from the two tier or mixed fleet system. But whatever the issue may be crew quality and service is inconsistent. When we landed at Newcastle a crew member announced that the flight was only 30 minutes behind schedule! Well marvellous not in my opinion. Having just flown around the world on another airline which was able to operate twelve out of thirteen flights either on time or ahead of schedule I have to say that I remain generally unimpressed.,3/10
315,British Airways customer review,"LHR-PHL BA067 19th April. One of the features of a British Airways (BA) flight that attracted me in the past was the breadth of special-meal options. This until recently included a ""seafood meal"". Indeed ten years ago BA had fisherman's pie as an option in economy class not just the horrible and relentless chicken-or-pasta - then they boasted of their support for the British fishing industry - no longer. Seafood meals are gone. Why? From a BA response: ""I'd like to inform you that the meals have been removed due to the low volumes with many of our customers now choosing other options"". Indeed. If no seafood meal exists then there is no choice there are no options. There is only chicken-or-pasta. Really what would it take to offer a ""cold seafood meal"" a tuna-fish salad and a bread roll? One more reason to choose BA is gone. One more reason to fly with a Middle Eastern airline such as Etihad who still care about service of a sort that BA has started to abandon.",5/10

Food quality was good not excellent but the film choice was great. Flat bed seats were comfortable enough. The breakfast was a little skimpy. The major downside was that for the money you pay for business class you should not have to pay to choose a seat at booking. BA will let you choose seats 7 days in advance if you are a mileage plan 1st elevated tier or better member but if not then you have to wait until 24 hours ahead. Of course you can always fork over another $113 to pre-reserve a seat. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.,7/10

Everything great apart from the final leg to DUB Gatwick didn't send our bags (even though we had a 6 hour layover) then preceded to keep us hanging in DUB for another 5 hours on the promise that they were on the next flight and the next ground staff of Aer Lingus were great too would fly all again.,10/10

319,British Airways customer review,23/3/2015 LHR-SIN BA011 First. Awful from booking to completion of the flight. As a BA. Gold executive member at time of booking some 11 months ago booked this flight on the new A380 only to be told by BA in May 2014 the equipment had been changed to the extremely old 744 due to technical issues. Sold feeling a little let down secured seats 1a and 2a on the 744 these are the best of a bad bunch as to I wonder why BA squeezes 14 seats into such a small area where other airlines only fit 8 seats into the front sections of 744s'. At the beginning of March I checked the booking online only to find that we had been moved to row 5 in the middle this was not acceptable. I called the BA gold line to object only to be given numerous contradicting excuses non of which were valid whilst on the flight I found out that the passenger in 1a was a lifetime gold member so. I can only assume that rank has its privileges. Now onto the flight arrogant staff with one exception really poor food served at different times as we were in the middle which meant we had different staff attending to us. Plane interior shabby not surprised for a 20 plus year old plane along with the PA being inaudible I felt this to be a safety issue and when mentioned I was ignored. I booked this flight for us a part of a special Far East holiday I had high expectations of BA First which have not been met in anyway what a total waste of money. Will now try to avoid flying BA in any of there classes once I have redeemed my Avios balance.,1/10

First leg not too bad apart from ridiculously narrow seat which is exactly the same as economy seat but a spare one in between. Usually seats are moved so that they are wider with a narrow seat in the middle. The return was terrible. BA do not pay for Cub Europe travellers to use Fast Track at security - disgraceful especially as it is particularly slow and inefficient. The lounge is mediocre at best. Absolutely not worth paying for Club. BA need to get a grip on their falling standards and increased prices.,4/10
323,British Airways customer review,Flight was cancelled with no explanation. No offer of help whilst having to stay the 2 extra days in Thailand. My flight from Bangkok to Heathrow was horrendous. Travelled World Traveller plus which is a total waste of money. We were served a meal within the first couple of hours of the 12 hour 35 minute flight. I was offered beef or Fish. It was actually Chicken. Apart from a tub of Ice Cream the next meal was not for another 8/9 hours. When the meal did arrive it was Pasta or Chicken. I asked for chicken. It was Fish! It was also vile. Sent it back. Judging back the food going up and down the aisle so did several others. I went to the back of the cabin for a cup if tea. I was advised if I wanted more tea could I retain the paper cup as they were running out!!! It was like being on some 3rd World airline. This is BA. Supposedly the flagship airline of our country. It's an absolute disgrace. I have flown for over 40 years and never again with BA.,1/10
324,British Airways customer review,The flight was to Dubai we travelled on the 9.45pm outgoing and 3.20pm incoming to Heathrow. We travelled in economy the seats were cramped and hard. It was freezing cold so cold in fact passengers wore coats with a blankets on them as well. The food was awful no choice whatsoever. I asked for a coffee because I was so cold but had to wait an hour and then had to ask again before I received it. The flight attendants on both flights did not look smart appeared to want to perform there duties as quickly as possible without any care for the passengers wishes so that they could stand and chat at back of flight and catch up with each other. We have had better flights on easyjet.,1/10
325,British Airways customer review,Flew F class on the A380 IAD-LHR-IAD. IAD lounge was charming great bar nice Concorde dining room with good service nice food and on my visit an excellent soup. Greeting staff very nice and bartenders that knew how to do their job. Only the slightest downfall was in the Club Class section of the lounge the finger sandwiches were dry as sand and just as flavorful. Station Manager Captain and Inflight Crew were was kind and generous with their time. Food was decent Champagne was great! IFS was strange and not easy to use but got help from FA's on both flights. Arrival at T5 was shocking. Like a heard of rabid bovine charging for the exits. Shoved like sardines into small trains with nothing to hold onto everyone started to tumble. Processing through fast track however was a breeze. Return. F check in is at the far end of the terminal agent at the counter had the personality of wall paper paste. Concorde Room staff were delightful breakfast was nice Massage was ok. Train to gate not nearly the terror it was on arrival. Boarding for First was a snap FA's top notch food ok. Arrival into IAD was as joyus as surgery with long walks confusing machines little help. Overall after reading so much negative about BA I was at least made to feel special at every stop except check in at T5.,9/10
326,British Airways customer review,My wife and I flew business class LHR-HKG 23/1/15 on a 777-200 seats 11 E&F. Check-in was ok once it got started this took several minutes as the woman at the counter was chatting with 2 friends. The lounge was good overall if a bit crowded and over heated. There was snack type offerings until 6.30pm when hot food was supplied This was very well cooked and presented the Thai green curry was excellent so compliments to the chef. Boarding was on time and efficient unlike our previous BA experience at HKG. We found the middle seats on this plane a bit cramped but comfortable for sleeping. The inflight food was very good I had a chicken and rice dish my wife had braised beef which she says was excellent I do think dessert and cheese should be offered. Unlike our last BA flight 5 weeks ago the crew on this flight were excellent friendly and attentive. The IFE selection is fair but the screen is square and is small compared to that on the A380 (and very small compared to CX). Thanks to the FA's we had a very enjoyable trip. We would fly BA again but only if the price was very competitive the staffing inconsistencies worry me some what this is really a management issue and should be addressed if it were the BA brand would be more competitive.,6/10
327,British Airways customer review,"Flew MIA-LHR in First. Seats 5a and 5k. This was my first time in BA first and I was really impressed. From the moment my boyfriend and I walked up to check in to the moment we left the plane we were very well looked after. The food was nice and particularly enjoyed the ""buddy dining"". My gooseberry crumble went down well. I got around 2 hours sleep as the jet stream and storm that was hitting the North Eastern U.S made our flight very bumpy but also super fast. Flying time being little over 7 hours 20 mins. I must mention the cabin crew who were very helpful and professional. We bought the seats in the sale and it was money well spent.",9/10
328,British Airways customer review,"BA191 19th Jan London Heathrow to Austin. Legroom in economy is too small. I'm 6'2"" and just don't fit. On a long haul flight recently I sat with my knees sticking out into the aisle and adjacent seat space for 10 hours.",4/10
329,British Airways customer review,Miami to Brussels with a change at Heathrow terminal 5. Lounge in Miami was ok ample choice of spirits but very basic champagne. Food: lots of cold cuts cheeses and some pastries. Plane: rather dated 747 and not very clean. FA's very courteous and extremely friendly - great choice of very good champagnes wines and spirits. Where BA fails: the poor quality of the food - extremely basic without any luxury items - not acceptable at all for a First product - IFE just ok. Seat kk - FA gave assistance for the sleeping position. Connecting flight to Brussels: I was informed by the - once again very friendly and courteous FA - that BA did cancel the fruit platter as a special meal. Is fruit also too expensive? Will move to other companies for long distance flights.,6/10
330,British Airways customer review,Flew MEX-LHR-TLS with BA and was very surprised having seen some negative feedback on here. Flight departed on time we were received well by staff at check-in and had no problems leaving MEX. Aircraft a 747 which was old yet fairly clean. Entertainment system was a little dated but once they got it working provided light relief. Service was very good staff were attentive whilst not overwhelming which is important on a night flight: we were not disturbed but knew refreshments could be brought when requested. Terminal 5 was easy to navigate and flight to TLS left almost on time. Uneventful second flight but nevertheless a good experience. Overall good service and communicative staff dated aircraft and equipment. Would definitely recommend service far better than other transatlantic airlines I have experienced.,8/10
331,British Airways customer review,LHR - Helsinki in Business Class. I happened to fly on this flight as I booked a flight to Shanghai with Finnair in business and BA are a Oneworld partner. Although the cabin crew were very attentive I feel that Club Europe is not worth the extra money considering the length of flight and extra services provided. The aircraft was a brand new A320 with leather seats but there was no extra legroom in the Club Europe section. The seats were the same as in the economy section the only difference being that the middle seat is not in use. There is a movable partition separating the two cabins presumably to offer maximum flexibility for the airline. Hot towels were provided before takeoff but no welcome drinks. The generous bar service started shortly after take off followed by a rather disappointing meal. Considering that it was a 2.5h lunchtime flight all that was on offer was a cold meat platter with a salad and a bread roll. I have had better service in Economy on BA short hall flights in the late 90s. Furthermore I recently flew on a China Eastern Airlines domestic flight of similar length on business class on a new A320 and the seats were in a 4-abreast configuration with much more legroom and I was served with a hot meal! There was no personal entertainment - the overhead screens showed the moving map for the duration of the flight. I do like BA but if you are flying short hall and are considering Club Europe I suggest saving your money and flying in the economy cabin. These low ratings reflect my expectations of business class and not the airline overall.,6/10
332,British Airways customer review,LHR-JNB-CPT. Upper deck on A380. 2x3x2 arrangement far from ideal for the trio in the middle although dividing up the club world cabin helps. Seats otherwise identical to usual BA business class. Window seats are best because of lockers at the side. Take-off remarkably quiet and smooth. Dinner service quick - in marked contrast to recent Emirates flight on A380. Food actually very good including a main course salad with 'warmed salmon' which was as good as in any restaurant. Slow disembarkation at JNB. Huge confusion about whether luggage had to be retrieved and re-checked in (check in at LHR informed us it was ticketed all the way to our final destination) and where we had to go for domestic transfer. Eventually arrived in excellent SLOW lounge 45 mins after leaving plane. 2 hr flight on 737 to CPT uneventful and quick baggage retrieval.,7/10
333,British Airways customer review,Muscat - Abu Dhabi - London. Delayed over two hours no vouchers offered. No welcome drinks or papers offered on the ground both sectors. Not all screens opened for the front row to watch the safety video. No cabin checks done on one side ex Abu Dhabi. Menus left on the seat arms in the middle of the night. Crew did not seem to have any supervision or experience.,2/10
334,British Airways customer review,A380 Club World HKG-LHR. Overall a very good flight with BA. I had a good window seat with direct aisle access and fortunately the cabin was not particularly busy so the toilet did not cause any disturbance. I find the seat very comfortable for eating lounging and sleeping although a mattress topper would make sleeping even more comfortable. The half folding table is great when you just have a drink or your phone charging but of course this has to become the table when a meal service starts so it is a shame there isn't a separate table. The inflight entertainment is excellent I do not understand any criticism of this as the screen is large and good quality and there is a large choice of films and TV. The catering however continues to be poor with BA. While the menu sounds great and dishes generally look good they often fall down when you actually eat them. As this was an overnight flight the meals were designed lighter and the champagne and canapés starter sounded perfect they were however 3 limp tasteless bite sized things. This to me is BA's weakest area and they really need to improve their catering offering in order to compete with other airlines. Service from cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient and always calling me by my name wherever they see me in the cabin.,8/10
335,British Airways customer review,LHR to BKK outbound on Boeing 777 SIN to LHR inbound on Boeing 747. Outbound flight delayed (which seems to happen on a regular basis for this flight) which meant a missed connection in BKK. Flight ok but the catering was ridiculous on a 11 hr sector only 2 choices which meant they ran out of chicken after about 5 rows and everyone else had to make do with the vegetarian option. Flight back was on time still only 2 choices of meals but the crew were excellent very friendly and approachable. The IFE was very limited compared to the Middle Eastern carriers and BA really do need to up their game if they're to compete with Emirates Etihad and Qatar on these routes. It's also much easier to fly with those airlines if you are from any part of the UK other than London and the Southeast of England as BA only do long haul from LHR and LGW.,5/10
336,British Airways customer review,VIE-LHR on Nov 29 on an Airbus 320 in Economy - straightforward evening point to point flight with a mixed fleet crew. Flight departed on time and landed ahead of time in Heathrow which is a rare thing these days. No luggage to check and web check-in was working fine. Plane featured the new slim seats which are a step back in both comfort and legroom. Mixed fleet FA's were pleasant however the service was not particularly well organized. It took them quite some time for the service to start and it took more than 30 minutes to get a drink after the sandwich has been served. On the other hand the bacon sandwich was actually good and full bar service was offered. Other than the “required service” of sandwich drink and duty free the crew was pretty much in hiding mode. Service not quite up to usual BA standards. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE which this time was quite busy but not overcrowded. Lounge as such is acceptable but far from great. Still believe that BA offers one of the best economy products on the European market and flying them is in general a pleasant experience. (Oneworld Sapphire).,9/10
337,British Airways customer review,LHR to Seattle return in WT+ a thoroughly enjoyable experience on each journey. Both flights more or less on time with excellent crew on both legs very attentive and cheerful with plenty of drink runs and quite tasty meals. Entertainment quite good with a huge choice of movies TV and music. On arrival into Seatac I was through immigration and customs with my luggage and in my limo in under an hour. On arrival into Heathrow terminal 5 it took about the same amount of time. I've been flying this route for the past twenty five years on average two to three times a year and BA is certainly the best airline flying to Seattle.,5/10
338,British Airways customer review,LHR-BGO on A319. Flight on time and only half full. Drinks and snack on this early departure. Crew very good.,10/10
339,British Airways customer review,Can't say anything negative about British Air. Our flight was cancelled in Philadelphia due to mechanical problems. They put us up in a quality hotel gave us meal vouchers and kept us informed of the flight status gave us an extra day at the hotel since it was a late flight. I missed my connection to Dubai had to wait at Heathrow for 6 hrs. Missed 2 days of work but can't get angry they did all they could and would fly BA again.,9/10
340,British Airways customer review,BA16 Singapore to London. B777 World Traveller cabin. One of the most comfortable economy class flights I have had despite the fact the seating was on the more cramped side. The ambience of the cabin was very calming and soothing and the service from the young crew members enthusiastic pleasant and courteous. Managed to sleep 6 hours made the 13 hour shorter. Food was delicious and water runs in between meals very helpful to keep us hydrated. Compared to Air France which is self service appreciated that BA crew does the water runs. One complaint is the entertainment system which featured touch screen did not work on my seat but small matter. Overall a very relaxing soothing pleasant smooth flight made the 13 hours fly by quickly. This is my new favorite airline to London and offers great value for money compared to Singapore Airlines.,9/10
341,British Airways customer review,Travelled to and from India recently in Club World. Outbound to Hyderabad and return from Mumbai. Outbound we had the 787 which is a nice plane to travel on when in Club World. It was definitely helped by the fact that the cabin was only 40% full. I was surprised that they had only loaded one of the cold options as a main meal. Not what you would expect from a full service airline. On the return from Mumbai flew on a 777 which is showing its age. The crew were very distant and far from warm. The hot dish for breakfast (a frittata) was tasteless and given that this was the main meal for the flight (due to time of departure) was disappointing. I agree with previous reports that the more experienced crew are more distant and lacking in customer service when compared with the newer crew. Based on my flying experience over the past few years I would prefer to fly with the mixed fleet crew. They are definitely more approachable. Overall flights were fine and on time. The above demonstrates failures in service levels which once again confirms that all of the 'enhancements' being introduced by BA are going in one direction the wrong one!,4/10
342,British Airways customer review,BA 83 from LHR to LAX first time on Airbus A380-800. Very comfortable quiet and smooth flight. The aircraft was exceptionally quiet on takeoff. Food and service top notch. Nice to have a free beer and wine with lunch. First time in LHR which I found to be a zoo but excellent duty free shopping. LAX can also be a zoo but that's to be expected. BA flight crew very professional and courteous. Would fly them again especially on the A380.,9/10
343,British Airways customer review,Travelled from Gatwick to Orlando on the 24th October with BA and I was very disappointed. For a full service airline the service was no better than a budget carrier. We were travelling with 3 children in our party of 11 and were seated at the rear of the plane. Both there and back the kids meals had run out by the time they reached us as had the edible options of adult meals. The cabin was hot which made for 2 very uncomfortable flights. We had to go and fetch our own complimentary drinks and snacks which my daughter did because she was so hungry - had she not gone we wouldn't even of been aware that they were available. Lesson learned - never fly BA again.,5/10
344,British Airways customer review,Flight LGW to TFS in Business. Like another reviewer found the new business cabin to be 'sardine class'. Seats now thin and uncomfortable especially for a four hour short-haul narrower and with materially less leg-room than before the same as economy. Now it is not possible to read a newspaper without turning at an angle to the middle seat and is impossible to work at a laptop as there is simply not enough room. One wants to like and use BA but this really is hit wicket in the club cabin. Unusually in my experience one of the FAs was rather disinterested in providing the usual club service too.,3/10
345,British Airways customer review,"I have after years of loyalty finally had it with BA. Every flight is late the catering gets worse and worse and the attitude of the crew has also deteriorated. I have taken 5 flights in 2 months and every single sector has been late. Even the crew in first class have no idea what ""service"" means - I have to ask for things 2 or 3 times I am not offered anything unless I ask the food is inedible (they tried to serve me a poached egg which I could have played squash with) they ran out of bottled water in a flight out of LHR I cannot find any flights when I can use my free companion voucher or use my miles to upgrade. they won't even allow my PA to deal my flights for me. it just seems the rules and attitude of their management has become so far removed from their promise To Fly to Serve.",3/10
346,British Airways customer review,Flew from London to Calgary. The seats in the new Dreamliner are awful. It was bad enough sitting in the seat but when the person in front of me lowered his seat it became impossible. His seat was right on my legs that shows how little room there is on these planes. Staff started serving meals all of a sudden went by about 7 or 8 rows of us and forgot to come back to feed us.,1/10
347,British Airways customer review,Very impressed with Premium Economy on BA Sydney to Heathrow and return. Nice also to have an unsolicited upgrade to Business on return Singapore to Sydney.,10/10
348,British Airways customer review,Flew from LGW to Catania. Lounge at Gatwick was good and staff very attentive no lounge at Catania airport and given vouchers instead which we got a rotten cup of coffee from the BA approved cafe next to the non Schengen passport control. Flights both ways were good and we liked the Pilot pointing out Lake Geneva and telling us about our route so nicely. The return flight back to LGW the Captain was hard to hear and wasn't so interesting. That aside on both journeys we felt well looked after with charming FAs. The food was also good too and we landed on time. Baggage came very quickly at LGW but at Catania airport it was a bit of a carnival! I'm afraid Catania airport is the worst airport I've been through but there you go! I think it is one of the joys of travelling.,9/10
349,British Airways customer review,Travelled to Cyprus from Gatwick in economy as thought this would be fine as use them internally in UK. As we are tall thought seat pitch would be same as home. Wrong. Dreadful flight in extremely cramped cabin my husband was virtually trapped by the seat in front and the only saving grace was that we had a spare seat in between us otherwise I think we would have been standing most of the way. Poor service and truly awful food if you could call it food. Wrap and small roll with nice chocolate dessert. Wrap was soggy and inedible roll dry and hardly had any filling. Only one round of drinks then tea etc with food on a flight of4.5 hours. Really smelly toilets and air conditioning poor. Aircraft old and just a bad flight experience. Took off late too! Have travelled in considerably better flights with charter airlines and following this experience WILL NOT be patronising BA again in economy once we have suffered the return flight! Have gone business class which is good but economy is dreadful.,2/10
350,British Airways customer review,BA92 4/10/14 YYZ-LHR B787 G-ZBJE. If you want to know what Ryanair long haul will be like sit in E on the BA 787. Appalling legroom seat width and non functioning IFE. Gold Card holder flying around 200 trips a year. Absolutely horrendous experience good luck to anyone taking the 12hr+ trip to Chengdu on it! New plane with the smallest seats ever. Many passengers tried to stand the entire trip to avoid the discomfort! If you are anything more than a medium build and have a bum and hips you will have a very uncomfortable flight. I am not one to moan but this is the end for me BA!,1/10
351,British Airways customer review,BA16 SYD-LHR 4 Sept Brand new 777 great VDU and excellent music sound quality with own headphones. Supplied headphones did not work. Warm attentive stewards. Low salt meals very tasty. Always served first though would have liked standard English breakfast - not low salt. Seat though standard economy was soft. BA9 LHR-Bangkok 18 Sept Older 777. Stewardesses interested and human in their approach. VDU not that brilliant. Food also quite satisfying. Bags on both occasions arrived promptly. Well done BA.,8/10
352,British Airways customer review,LHR to Amman Jordan Airbus 321. Outward flight delayed 2 hours due to unloading a bag and technical problems on the ground. Flight completely full upgraded to Club World. Cabin crew there excellent and attentive. Seat comfort was OK but not special. Food was good. One very small toilet next to the pilot door for Club World passengers. Terminal 1 on its last legs but check in was quick. Return trip was in Economy-what a difference!,7/10
353,British Airways customer review,"2 recent flights LHR to SFO (12 hrs) - 7th Sept then San Diego to LHR (9 hrs) 21st Sept BA 272. Club World cabin. Wife and I have flown business class on - Singapore Air New Zealand Emirates Air Malaysia and Virgin on 20 occasions to New Zealand by various routes so we are familiar with the service provided at this level by other airlines. BA in our opinion doesn't come close. Briefly: - being charged £284 extra to reserve seats how do they get away with it? Personally we felt uncomfortable with the back-to-front seat layout too enclosed and awkward to get out of (we were in the inner cell) and I would imagine irritating for the outside passengers as well to have people clambering over their legs. Details - ""hot towels"" threadbare scraps of cloth that were stone cold in under ten seconds and then only one and nothing for morning wake-up cheap looking menus lukewarm tea and coffee thrust over the barrier in mugs a sudden rattle as the screen was lowered and a basket of bread rolls thrust under your nose having to reach out sideways to receive meals embarrassment at disturbing the outside passenger trays passed over them minute napkins (expect paper sheets anytime soon) cabin crew just doing their job walking up and down the aisles at great speeds so as to avoid being asked for something cold soggy croissants which are an insult to croissants and don't get me started about the bacon roll! We were offered a drink before dinner and had to ask for a top-up one glass of wine with dinner (dry tough steak) and a refill after we had finished eating no after dinner drinks were offered. Lights out-see you in the morning! I could go on but suffice to say we are so disappointed that our national airline could be so far behind the others.",2/10
354,British Airways customer review,Orlando Florida (MCO) - London Gatwick (LGW). Wed Aug 27 return Sun Sep 7. We paid over 150 dollars more for our seats and didn't even get a choice of what we wanted for our meal. In addition the inflight entertainment didn't work on our return trip.,2/10
355,British Airways customer review,LHR-HKG on the new A380 in premium economy and it was a great trip staff were friendly and the food was very good for a gluten free meal.

356,British Airways customer review,"LHR-MCT-LHR. Excellent outbound flight. Tasty food and wine very friendly cabin crew although the entertainment system isn't up to much in terms of choice. Different story on the way back though. Stand-offish cabin crew and no white champagne. Rose only as ""we haven't been fully catered"". Not a big thing but indicative of how slip shod BA can sometimes be these days. The seat is comfortable so I slept all the way back rather than try their food and drink.",5/10
357,British Airways customer review,I'm regularly flying Perth-Hong Kong-London-Port of Spain these days. Perth to London is via Cathay Pacific business class which is excellent. Sadly I then have to swap to BA for London to Trinidad where 'Club World' is a euphemism for 'slum in the sky'. Cathay Pacific business class seats - 4 across the width of the aircraft. BA Club Slum - 8 across. If you're on a night flight that means tripping over people or being tripped over. Decor is abysmal service is average to poor. Seat and personal space design is lousy - but there's not much space to work with. Film choice is limited and the video screen is tiny and reminiscent of old analogue 625 lines TVs of the 80s. The overall impression is a dreary coffin-like space with minimal storage crummy entertainment average food and indifferent service. Don't do it! Fly with someone else - anyone else!,1/10
358,British Airways customer review,LGW-Faro return 19th/26th Aug Economy 2 adults 2 children. Whole experience from Check In to arrival in Faro outstanding. As a regular traveller on this route have now got used to the ex BMI airbuses on this route the seating is perfectly comfortable despite the reduced seat pitch and have never had any problems when requesting more than one drink during the flight. The crew were fantastic in both directions and were totally service orientated from start to finish. Only one minor issue and that is the only one toilet at the rear for the whole economy cabin!,10/10
359,British Airways customer review,"LHR-YYZ. Checked in at 10.00am for my 13.10 departure. Check in was quick. Then proceeded through Fast Track which was not ""Fast"". The lounge was quite busy but the staff were very helpful. Departed on time and before take off were offered drinks. We were on the new B787 so the aircraft was nice and clean. I sat in 1F. It converted into a flat bed which was good. About 20 mins into the flight the drinks run came through. When then we asked for what we will having for lunch. I choose the Salmon for starters which was excellent. For mains I choose the chicken option which was good but the veg was very hard. Finally I choose the ice cream for dessert. Landed on time and got our bags quickly.",8/10
360,British Airways customer review,BA 56 JNB-LHR 15 August 2014 Business class A380 upper deck. The flight did not live up to expectations. Too many seats makes business class cabin look crowded narrow seats with each row facing in opposite direction no problem with this but this impedes free movement for some of the seats specially the ones in the middle and window side also not much space for storage of personal items like specs etc. The window blinds of this section in upper deck were kept lowered through the entire 11 hr flight with no cue of any outside light whatsoever until we landed at Heathrow and parked to the stand felt like sitting in a light proof box with artificial illumination. I thought you need to keep the blinds open for landing and take off? The 747 business class is more comfortable than A380.,5/10
361,British Airways customer review,I was on BA 835 from Dublin to LHR on 25th July 2014 which left Dublin at 13.05 and my travel plans were such that I had sufficient time to connect with my flight from LHR to Hong Kong. On leaving Dublin the pilot opined that it was a good day to fly! On reaching LHR we were informed that due to thunderstorms we were to be diverted to Gatwick and were running out of fuel. In summary we sat on the tarmac at Gatwick for over two hours with only scant updates as to when we would be taking off for LHR and the temperature inside the cabin became oppressive which added to the misery. On reaching LHR BA staff were in my opinion ineffectual with a 'sorry and shrug of the shoulders' and with no real assistance for those passengers on connecting flights. I was lucky as I managed to get on my flight to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific but with only moments to spare after a dash to terminal 3. Whilst I understand the volatility of the weather the real point of my review is that BA appears to have abandoned the basics of customer service and this is clearly reflected in BA's absence in the top 10 airline ratings. Could do a lot better!,4/10
362,British Airways customer review,06.40 flight 4 August Glasgow to London City cancelled with no explanation.

Third rate which is what I have come to expect from them.,1/10
363,British Airways customer review,"Toronto to London in WTP on a 787 and London to Toronto in club world on 747. There were elements of both flights where BA seemed to be back to their old self. The Dreamliner in WTP was on time with some of the best cabin service I've experienced from a male attendant who smiled couldn't do enough and was just professional. BA seemed to have dropped some of the nice touches though so no hot towel soft drink before take off or menu cards - looks like WTP seems to have been demoted (again). Fast bar service and good entree before the WTP service morphed into WT for breakfast which has reverted to ""muffin or nuffin"" and Ts and Cs and juice from paper cups. It really is an insult after an overnight flight and is ill thought out and penny pinching. Landing early at Heathrow and fast bags ended a good overall flight. The return flight in club was one of my best ever. The lounge had a better range of hot and cold food though most of the furniture still needs replacing. On board two male crew upstairs on the jumbo were superb. Friendly helpful and starting off well with a 2nd champagne before take off due to delays in boarding. Fast bar service and an excellent lunch with the sea bass being exceptional. A calm oasis on the upper deck allowed some sleep before the now tired afternoon tea was served. Real personalised service with a smile reminded me of old times of BA at it's best. An on time landing and fast bags off finished an excellent flight. Why can't they do this more often? (Answer - variable cabin crew).",10/10
364,British Airways customer review,BA206 from Miami to LHR on upper deck dinner took over 3 hours to complete. 2 staff obviously not sufficient. Very old 747 TV screens going from colour to B&W frustrating as had more than enough time to watch a couple of movies while dinner was not served.,3/10
365,British Airways customer review,Flew LCY to MAD in Business only 3 people in a cabin for 12 no welcome no pre take off drinks very poor service awful food warm drinks turbulence as we got in the air dealt with very well. Overall very poor service.,3/10
366,British Airways customer review,Flew JNB-LHR return. Only considered BA because they fly the A380 on the route which is undoubtedly the best aircraft to fly on. Only hit minor turbulence in both directions so one can easily get some rest. BA have undoubtedly upped their game in premium economy - the 744 equivalent was about the worst in the sky. The A380 is a considerable improvement. Only gripe is that on premium economy you get no special boarding benefits so by the time I got on the plane the cabin was already full - can only assume the others all had the relevant frequent flyer privilege. Anyway the food was superb with proper crockery and cutlery attentive service and superb entertainment. But I really only recommend flying the A380 if you are unlucky to find yourself on the old 744's expect the opposite - a cramped cabin with mediocre seats and regular economy class service.,9/10
367,British Airways customer review,LHR-YVR-LHR. Flew in in First on very shabby 744 which was nothing like First was displayed on the BBC documentary about BA. Squeezing so many passengers into the nose of a 744 is a joke. The staff both ways were excellent and attended to the half empty cabins with great attention to detail. OB were the old contract crew and IB was a standby mixed fleet crew not normal on this route. Food from LHR was palatable and from YVR was awful. On the return leg the IFE was faulty. The fast track OB was a free for all as we were bus fed to the aircraft on return how it should be. I feel the BBC has hurt BA with First passengers having their expectations raised to abnormal levels only to be let down by an average product on very tired equipment not as shown on TV. We were generally happy due to the fact that I used Avios and an AMEX voucher for the flight if we would have paid for the flights then it would have been disappointing and would have chosen Air Canada. BA really do need to sort out their dated equipment sooner rather than later before more premium clients opt for other carriers especially on the middle eastern and far eastern routes. We will continue to use BA due to the Avios rewards which demands loyalty for financial reasons I could not recommend for passengers having to pay for either CW or First.,8/10
368,British Airways customer review,We paid top money for Club Europe and upon leaving the UK we thought it was well worth it as great helpful check in fast track immigration and lovely lounge. Once on plane saw a number of economy passengers throw their hand luggage up in the open lockers above the Club Europe passengers which we feel should be policed as the late arrivals of the Club Europe passengers had no room to put their hand luggage. Service and meals were average but really not worth the extra money especially once we got to Rome when all the Club Europe Passengers luggage was last off we waited close to 30 minutes. Hopefully British Airways will sort out the Rome baggage handlers. Flying them again next week we hope for a better experience.,5/10
369,British Airways customer review,London - BKK Premium economy 19/6/14. I always travel EVA Air business but this time I had to get into BKK early having been told by many that BA Business is at best rubbish I decided to save some cash and go P/Economy seat no: 14A remarks on flight seating at best ok service seemed tired but the real downer was the food the plane was nowhere near full but by the time they got to me most of the food had gone and I was left with some sort of pasta dish - totally inedible. I must admit I didn't put anything near my mouth just pressed one of the pasta flutes - cold dry and hard. I was given a pat of butter type stuff alas nothing to spread it on bread wise maybe it was put there to grease the runners on the seat. Drinks G&T were served once choice of coffee or tea with second course at least I did get first pick had tea a very hard type of cake thing egg sausage mushroom was the so called dish - again poor. The only redeeming factors were I didn't go business class as the seats dated back to the eighties in a 2/4/2 configuration unlike EVA 1/2/1 lie flat and we arrived 20 minutes early.,2/10
370,British Airways customer review,EDI-LHR-FCO-LHR-EDI. EDI lounge good. Flight to LHR on time food decent attentive crew. North lounge at T5 much better than chaotic South lounge. Flight to FCO by 3 cabin 767 so upgraded using avios - fully flat beds great FA's superb food good wine. Lounge at FCO okay food not great. Flight delayed at FCO due to storms at LHR so ample time to use the flat beds watch a film and relax. FA excellent food very good again. Overall the flights and service were superb.,10/10
371,British Airways customer review,LGW - Paphos 4th June. Check in and fast track security was very easy and we were airside within 5 minutes. As we were flying at 2.45 we decided to have some lunch in the lounge. The lounge was busy but there was still plenty of space to relax. The food options were poor to say the least with soup sandwiches or ham salad being the only items on offer. My wife who is a vegetarian was not impressed as she had to make do with an egg mayonnaise sandwich. Having been told when we checked in that the flight was 'bang on time' the screen informed us at 2.05 that we should proceed to gate 101. After a 10 minute stroll we arrived at the gate to be told there was a delay to the flight. Why on earth this information could not have been passed through to the lounge is a mystery. No pre flight drinks were offered and we eventually took off about an hour late. Pre lunch drinks were served after 40 minutes and then lunch about 30 minutes after that. The crew were very nice but rather stressed and mentioned that the plane (737-400) should not have been used on this route. My wife had pre ordered a veggie meal that was not loaded on the plane but the very nice but stressed FA said she could have hers. It was a nice gesture but my wife felt slightly guilty about taking it although she did and enjoyed her meal. I was told that there was only one option left for me and I could have Kedgeree or Kedgeree so that's what I had. It was OK but not particularly hot. Arrived at Paphos about 45 minutes late with our priority luggage being in the last 6 cases to arrive on the carousel. Overall the flight was just OK although if it had not been for the excellent cabin crew it would have been disappointing. My wife did receive an email from BA within 2 days of our arrival saying they had let her down with the non arrival of her pre ordered food on this flight and apologised which is fare enough.,6/10
372,British Airways customer review,OSL-LHR June 8th. Two days after arriving I departed still less my check-in bag from June 6th. Flight delayed this is more often than not on most BA flights I have been on. Food offered in economy same Chicken Tikka sandwich or bean salad as seen on last 3 flights in a week on different routes. I would rather have the option to buy something I might want to eat. Cabin crew Brilliant nearly always are but its not just about the crew service but it's the only reason they have any customers.,1/10
373,British Airways customer review,London (LHR) to Houston (IAH) to London (LHR). T5 in Heathrow is crazy We been up and down the lifts and get train to other gates. We got boarding first then people comes in the plane. When the plane was ready to take off then 1 hour later food ready to give out to other people then nothing until 1 hour before we land. The seat was uncomfortable old and tired. The Cabin Crew were so miserable.,2/10
374,British Airways customer review,LHR-ATH-ATH June 2014. Both flights 1.5 hours late which always seems to be the case largely due to the old plane (767) used on this particular flight. Food average cabin crew variable-average overall. No apologies for lateness of flights which unacceptable-BA still seem to think that they are doing you a favour for letting you fly with them. Poor overall and am even considering using Easyjet as Gatwick closer to my home.,2/10
375,British Airways customer review,Tampa-Gatwick. Check in lousy. I can't believe I am writing this. Checking in 3 bags one weighed 32.7 kg the supervisor insisted I remove the .7kg (1lb) from the bag. I had to ask him if he was serious and he said he was. The person checking in next to me had the same problem. When you fly business class the reason you do is because you don't want stress this strictness doesn't help. Tampa airport didn't help the stress level either I had one carry on bag rucksack and a small bag for a laptop security to the gate insisted I was allowed two carry on's so I had to put two bags into one. Going through the third security the scanner showed I had something in my pocket. Body search revealed I had a few $ notes in my pocket. Security man 'when we say remove everything from your pocket we mean everything' I thought he was joking he wasn't. Lounge at Tampa Ok. Sandwiches freshly made and plenty of drinks reasonable space. Option of going to one world lounge as well. Boarding aircraft clean all seats in club taken offered champagne by very friendly cabin crew. Food usual just edible (insulting to passengers as you are paying business class monies) flight landed late. Baggage collection happy to see two of my check in's come out first and sad to see the last bag come out last as the priority tag had got removed of the last bag.,6/10
376,British Airways customer review,I found BA to be the worst airline I have used. Flew LHR to Boston 2hr 56 min delay to start with. Cabin staff unhelpful and disinterested. Also leg room appalling with trim falling of the seat in front of me. It had the interior of an old knackered plane. I have flown Singapore Airlines who run rings around this bunch. I could have flown with Virgin instead for the same money and would have had a vastly superior less drab experience.,1/10
377,British Airways customer review,London Heathrow to Madrid on a Boeing 767-300. The outward flight was on a plane configured for Worldwide operation. i.e. with Club World World Traveller Plus and World Traveller classes. It was one of the newly refurbished ones. The economy cabin at 2-3-2 and leg room was excellent - I am 6 foot tall. Snack of a very nice chicken sandwich complimentary alcoholic drinks with a second run. Staff very efficient and friendly. We are Silver members of the Exec Club and the Cabin Service Director welcomed us by name. On time departure and slightly early arrival. The return flight was on a standard European configured aircraft but space was as good as the outward journey. On time departure and arrived into Heathrow 20 minutes early. Overall a great trip.,10/10
378,British Airways customer review,Flew to Vegas on 8th May and dismayed at the standard. Filthy seat back in front of me dismissed with a shrug by a steward. Only choice of meal was a lemon pasta although some food wrapped up in foil was brought with 3 chicken meals to share between 6 of us. Sandwiches crisps and nuts etc were refused when requested as an alternative; we were told by the stewardess not to sit in the area we did (around row 31) as it normally happened. The worst part though was aloof staff who actually come over as rude.,2/10
379,British Airways customer review,Once again a good flight from LHR to Warsaw in an A320. Cabin crew were very efficient and friendly on both outbound and inbound flights. I was tempted to upgrade for £72 when I booked the flights but decided not to due to the good catering service on the flight and the shortish journey. The wraps have been replaced by a flat bread sandwich which is much better! Looking forward to my next flight!,10/10
